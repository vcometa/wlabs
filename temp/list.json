				"size: "60 – 73cm

				"coat": "The coat is long-haired and wiry with a dense under layer. Colors of white with markings of ivory, light yellow, or pale orange are permitted by breed standards",

				"care": "It may be necessary to pluck the Affenpincher’s coat. This is usually done by a dog trimming specialist but it is possible to learn how to do it yourself.

				"training": "Affenpinschers learn commands fairly quickly. Ensure consistency in the training but make sure there is ample variety in the drills so your dog will not become bored",

				"coat": "The Afghan Hound has a very long, fine coat. The hair on the face is short. Any color is accepted but the most common colors are red through shades of beige, often with a darker mask",

				"care": "The grooming of the coat of these dogs requires a full hour, twice a week. The best method is to comb each handful of hair from the skin outwards so that no tangles can be overlooked, being careful not to break any of the hairs. Keep the ear passages clean. Afghans should be bathed about every two months, using a good quality dog shampoo which does not dry the skin. Grooming is so basic to the care of an Afghan Hound that no one should consider owning one who doesn't have the time to do it",

				"character": "These are independent, proud, and noble dogs that are calm indoors but very active and fast outdoors. These intelligent animals are not slavishly obedient. They are brave, and vigilant, not noisy, and cautious with strangers. By instinct, they will chase anything that moves quickly. The males can try to dominate",

				"training": "These dogs are not suitable for inexperienced people. Their independent nature makes them difficult to train and they will never be totally and consistently obedient. Hitting or shouting at them lowers their respect for their handler. The best way to achieve anything with these dogs is to use a firm yet soft hand with them",

				"social": "The dogs can be rather dominant towards other males. They get along fine with children provided the dogs are not pestered by them and are left alone in their own territory. They are probably better for a family with older children. An existing cat will be accepted. Remember it is in their blood to chase anything that runs quickly",

				"exercise": "The Afghan Hound needs lots of exercise. Try bicycling with the dog every day to give it the chance to get rid of its energy, but do not forget their hunting instinct. Only allow an Afghan to run freely off the leash where it cannot run off",

				"remarks": "A well groomed Afghan Hound is a marvelous sight and the dog knows it. This is a dog for the real enthusiast; you must appreciate its independent and sometimes unfathomable character"

With the right handler, Airedale Terriers can do well in various dog sports including defence dog trials",

				"social": "In general, Airedale Terriers get on well with cats and other household animals, and they are very patient with children. They sometimes try to dominate other dogs, but this depends upon their training and the individual dog",

				"exercise": "The Airedale Terrier has an average demand for exercise and will be happy with three walks around the neighbourhood a day on the leash plus playing in the yard. Most of them love to play with a ball, swim, or retrieve objects, and once fully grown will happily run along"

				"country": "Japan",

				"skills": "Vermin destroyer and family pet",

They are good watchdogs but won't bark too much. But they can also be independent and try to dominate. They will become friends with their family but never very submissive",

				"training": "With a confident handler who is consistent in this approach, the Japanese Akita can learn a great deal. They do best if the training drills are not constantly repeated. They are not a suitable breed for beginners unless expert advice is followed very closely",

				"social": "Most Japanese Akitas have no time for other dogs and prefer not to have any other dogs for company. They virtually all tend to be extremely dominant with other dogs, especially ones of their own sex. They need to become acquainted with cats and other animals early in their lives to prevent later problems. They usually get on reasonably well with children, provided the children do not invade the dog's own territory. They should never be considered a children's playmate. Strangers will get a rather reserved reception from this dog",

				"exercise": "Japanese Akitas have considerable stamina but if you miss a long walk one day, they will accept it without a fuss. Never forget that they have strong hunting instincts so if they are permitted to run free, there is a strong possibility they will run away",

			"Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog": {

				"skills": "Watchdog and family pet",

				"origin": "The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog results from three generations of an old breeding program of PaPa Buck Lane of Rebecca, Georgia, USA. The program started back in the 1800's and was intended to rescue the 'plantation dog' of Southern Georgia that was nearly extinct. This rare, bulldog-type guard dog descends from Buck Lane's dog, named Otto. Lana Lou speaks of her granddaddy as always having had an "Otto"about the estate. One Otto was all one needed since these Bulldogs were capable of guard work and woods work. When PaPa Buck was killed by a train in 1943, his Otto proved his undying devotion by constant visitation and guard duty over the grave. Buck Lane's granddaughter, Lana Lou Lane, continued the breeding program until she passed away in her sleep on July 20th 2001. Like the Plott Hound, this muscular breed is the creation of one American Family, and its survival depends upon the nurturing it receives. Originating from English Bulldog Stock, this dog's ancestors functioned as cattle and pig herders, but the Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is bred solely for security and companionship",

				"size": "Height: 24 inches (61 cm) Weight: Dogs up to 100 pounds (47 kg) Females - about 78 pounds (34 kg) There is a considerable difference between the males and females. Males can be almost twice as heavy as the smallest females",

Colors include; brown; chocolate brindle; red-white red nose; chocolate red nose; chocolate and white red nose; chocolate red white tri-color; cocoa fawn red nose; red brindle black nose; mahogany and white brindle; sable brindle; black and tan; blue fawn; blue white; black; blue brindle, cinnamon, white and chocolate; red white fawn black mask nose; brown brindle, black brindle; red white with black mask; dilute sable; and sable",

				"care": "Little grooming is needed. Occasionally comb and brush to remove dead hair and cut down on shedding. Bathe once every two weeks. This breed is an average shedder",

				"character": "The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is a well-developed, exaggerated bulldog with a broad head and natural drop ears. The prominent muzzle is covered by loose upper lips. The prominent eyes are set well apart. The Alapaha's coat is relatively short and fairly stiff. Preferred colors are blue merle, brown merle, or red merle trimmed in white or chocolate & white. Also preferred are the glass eyes (blue), or marble eyes (brown and blue mixed in a single eye). The ears and tail are never trimmed or docked. The body is sturdy and very muscular. The well-muscled hips are narrower than the chest. The straight back is as long as the dog is high at the shoulders",

				"training": "The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is dutiful and quickly trainable. This breed is named as such for their streak of "royalty", It is a great watch and guard dog. They will fight to the death to defend their owners and make excellent companion dogs. Excellent with and protective of children. These are active, athletic and mindful dogs with a lot of heart. The objective in training this dog is to achieve a pack leader status. It is a natural instinct for a dog to have an order in their pack. When we humans live with dogs, we become their pack. The entire pack cooperates under a single leader. Lines are clearly defined. You and all other humans MUST be higher up in the order than the dog. That is the only way your relationship can be a complete success",

				"social": "These dogs can make good family dogs provided the family is always consistent and can cope with a boisterous dog. Enthusiasts for these dogs claim that they are loving with children.

				"coat": "The Alaskan Malamute has a thick, coarse outer coat with a greasy and woolly under-coat.

				"training": "Despite its friendly nature, this dog needs a firm hand in its training. The Malamute calls for a handler with plenty of confidence who understands the character of this dog. With such a handler these dogs can learn a great deal even including agility skills, although they will be outperformed in competition by one of the sheepdogs",

				"social": "Alaskan Malamutes generally get on well with children. They are friendly with everyone which makes them, of course, unsuitable as watchdogs. They can occasionally try to dominate other dogs of the same sex, but that's exceptional. If they have been introduced to cats when young there is no problem with them",

				"exercise": "Exercise is probably the most important element in an Alaskan Malamute's life. This breed needs copious amounts of exercise. If at least an hour each day of hard exercise with this dog is impossible get another type of dog. In some places where there is no snow, there are sled dog organizations which arrange competitions these dogs can enter with a wheeled cart in place of a sled",. Malamutes are happy whether they are indoors or outdoors, but they do not like to be alone. Keep this dog on the leash whenever it is taken out because it may try to run away"

				"skills": "Watchdog and family pet",

				"origin": "During the 19th century England, Ireland, and Scotland began to experiment with crosses between bulldogs and terriers, looking for a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog. The dog was bred first to bait bulls and bears. When baiting bulls was deemed inhumane, ratting (a sport where a number of rats were placed in a pit for a specified time with the dog) and dog fighting became more popular. Later the dogs became more commonly domesticated due to their loyalty, loving and gentle nature with their owners. In the United States, farmers and ranchers used this breed for protection, as catch dogs for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and to drive livestock. The breed was also used during World War I and World War II as a way of delivering messages on the battlefield. 

				"size": "The preferred shoulder-height is 45.7 to 48.4cm (18 to 19in) for males and 43.2 to 45.7(17 to 18in) for females. The correct relationship between height and weight is more important than these specific heights",

				"country": "United States of America",

				"skills": "Watchdog and family pet",

				"origin": "The early ancestors of this breed came from England, where applications included farm use, guarding, dog fighting, and companionship. Until the first part of the 19th century, the Bulldog was bred in England for the purpose of baiting bulls. Bulldogs pictured as late as 1870 resemble contemporary American Staffordshire Terriers to a greater degree than present-day Bulldogs. Some writers contend it was the White English Terrier, Fox Terrier, or the Black and Tan Terrier that was crossed with the Bulldog to develop the Staffordshire Terrier; all three breeds shared many traits, the greatest differences being in color, aggressiveness, and spirit. The cross of Bulldog and Terrier was called by several names, including Bull-and-Terrier Dog, Half and Half, and Pit Dog or Pit Bull terrier. Later, it assumed the name of Staffordshire Bull Terrier in England. These dogs began to find their way into America as early as 1870, where they became known as the Pit Dog and Pit Bull Terrier, then the American Bull Terrier, and still later as the Yankee Terrier",

The front legs are straight. The back legs are strong and prepared for heavy thrusting action. The tail is carried cheerfully with a slight curve. The gait is energetic and well-balanced",

				"social": "The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is an energetic and active dog. Due to their hunting nature, they are best suited for country and farm living rather than for city apartments, although the dog will do quite well if a large yard is provided. Being pack animals, they usually get along well with other dogs but had better be supervised with cats and other small animals. Gentle with children and they enjoy playing with them, but it is never wise to leave a small child unsupervised with the dog. The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is intelligent and responsive to training, though may be wilful at times. Make sure to become a good pack leader and socialize the dog well"

			"Australian Kelpie": {
			
				"skills": "Australians can be very proud of the Australian Working Kelpie. It is one of Australia's truly national dogs. A kelpie is most valuable in the paddocks and yards, gathering a mob of sheep, driving them to the yards and pens and forcing the sheep through races, up ramps and into sheds and trucks. Always alert and watchful, the Kelpie is required to be an independent thinker, though will also rely on various whistle commands made by its owner. There are about half a dozen commands to which the Kelpie is trained to respond, each of these commands directing the dog to perform certain tasks. and family pet",

				"origin": "The ancestors of the Kelpie were simply (black) dogs, called Colleys or Collies. The word "collie"has the same root as "coal"and "collier (ship)". Some of these collies were imported to Australia for stock work in the early 19th century, and were bred to other types of dogs (possibly including the occasional Dingo), but always with an eye to working sheep without direct supervision. Today's Collie breeds were not formed until about ten or 15 years after the Kelpie was established as a breed, with the first official Border Collie not brought to Australia until after Federation in 1901. Kelpies have been claimed to have some Dingo blood; as it was illegal to keep dingoes as pets, some dingo owners registered their animals as Kelpies or Kelpie crosses. Kelpies and dingoes are similar in conformation and colouring",

				"size": "Working Kelpies stand about 50 centimetres (19.5 inches) at the withers for females, 55 centimetres (21",5 inches) for males, and weigh between 14 and 21 kilograms (31-46 pounds). Ears are pricked, but some dogs have one or both ears flopped; the tail will often follow the coat type, and will vary between smooth and bushy. The dog's working ability is unrelated to appearance, so stockmen looking for capable working dogs disregard the dog's appearance",

				"coat": "The working Kelpie comes in three coat types: smooth, short, and rough. The coat can be almost every colour from black through light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, and a few have white points. Kelpies sometimes have a double coat, which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. Agouti is not unusual, and can look like a double coat",

				"care": "This breed is easy to groom. An occasional combing and brushing is all that it needs. Bathe only when necessary as it will remove the natural oils in the weather-resistant coat and dry out the skin. This breed is an average shedder",

				The Australian Kelpie is a working dog that demands a great deal of exercise, preferably with some kind of job to do. Their energy levels are extremely high. They need to be taken on long daily walks. Makes an excellent jogging companion",

				"social": "Kelpies are loyal, friendly, intelligent, energetic dogs that require a challenging job to be satisfactory companions. They need to be stimulated, as idle and bored dogs become frustrated, noisy, and destructive. With personalised love and attention, they can be very placid and faithful, although they do need space to run. A working bred Kelpie must have a job to do and plenty of exercise and mental stimulation to remain healthy and companionable. A Kelpie is not aggressive towards people and cannot be considered a guard dog, though he will certainly bark when necessary. Working Kelpies may nip when working stock and should be taught early not to do so to humans. Working-bred Kelpies have done quite well in dog sports, search and rescue work, and can be good family dogs if they receive sufficient physical and mental exercise. The breed is unsuitable for a sedentary life and would not thrive in an apartment setting. Show Kelpies generally excel in agility trials and may be shown in conformation in Australia. 'Riley', an Australian Kelpie, set the world record for dog jumping when he jumped 2",95 metres at the Casterton, Victoria Kelpie Festival. In his previous 30 high jumping competitions he was defeated only twice"

				"care": "There is little to the grooming of a Basset Hound. Remove dead and loose hairs when the dog is shedding with a rubber glove. Keep the ears clean by attending to them once a week, inside and out. Keep the claws short and when necessary clean the folds of skin. Do not give Bassets too many snacks as they have a tendency to become fat which is bad for them. Dogs with drooping eyelids should be given drops, prescribed by the veterinarian, occasionally. These dogs grow very rapidly when young and you must be sure they have a good nutritious and ample diet during this period",

				"social": "These dogs make superb playmates for children and fortunately get along fine with their own kind and with other animals. They are friendly towards strangers but if they sense danger they will bark loudly. They do not like to be left alone.

				"exercise": "This breed does not require much exercise and will be quite content with three trots around the block each day provided they can also play in the yard. Make sure your yard is adequately fenced because these dogs love to explore"

			"skills": "This breed has been honed over hundreds of years to be the consummate shepherd, vigilant, determined, moderate, and patient; they would be left alone with hundreds of sheep to guide, guard and sort out the different and unexpected problems that would arise over the summer or winter season. The Bergamasco is also great with all children and have been used as therapy dogs for handicapped children",

			"group": "F.C.I. Classification: Group 1: ; Section 1: ;", 

			"height": "Males: 22 1/2 - 24 1/2 in (58 – 62 cm) Females: 21 – 23 in (54 – 58 cm)",

			"weight": "Males: 70-84 pounds (32-38 kg) Females: 57-71 pounds (26-32 kg) "note": "These sizes are average; your dog can be smaller or bigger than average size",

			"coat": "The Bergamasco’s characteristic feature is its unique coat. The coat forms 'flocks' or loose mats, which cover the dog’s body and legs, and protect the dog from weather and predators. The Bergamasco coat is made up of three types of hair: undercoat, 'goat hair,' and outer coat. The undercoat is short, dense, and of fine texture. It is oily to the touch and forms a waterproof layer against the skin. The 'goat hair' is long, straight, and rough in texture. The outer coat is woolly and somewhat finer in texture than the 'goat hair",' The 'goat hair' and outer coat are not distributed evenly over the dog and it is this pattern of distribution that is responsible for the formation of the characteristic flocks. The coat from the withers down to the midpoint of the body is mostly 'goat hair' which forms a smooth saddle in that region. On the back of the body and the legs, the woolly outer coat is abundant and mingles with the reduced quantity of 'goat hair' in that region to form the flocks. The flocks are larger at the base than the end, flat, irregular in shape, and may sometimes open in a fan-shape. The hair on the legs also hangs in flocks rather than feathering. The flocks are never combed out. The hair on the head is mostly 'goat hair' but is somewhat less rough in texture; it is typically long and hangs over the eyes. The acceptable colors for this breed are solid gray or with gray patches, all possible shades of gray (including shadings of isabella and fawn), up to and including solid black, provided it is not shiny or lustrous. Solid white is not allowed but white markings are acceptable if they cover no more than one-fifth of the coat",

			"build": "The Bergamasco is a dog of medium size and rustic appearance. The body is compact and square in profile",

			"head": "The head is proportionate to the "size": "of the dog, with the skull and muzzle of equal length, parallel to one another, and joined at a pronounced stop. The skin on the head is tight with no wrinkles. The skull is slightly domed between the ears, and rounded at the forehead. The skull is at most as wide as it is long, and features a prominent occiput and a marked median furrow. The depth and width of the muzzle, measured at midpoint, are each about half the length of the muzzle. The muzzle is blunt, tapering only slightly toward the nose. The lips are tight and of black pigment. They just cover the teeth. The inner corner of the mouth reaches back to a vertical line drawn down from the outside corner of the eye. The cheeks are not very prominent. Disqualifications: Bridge of muzzle decidedly convex or concave. The jaw is wide, with a full complement of strong, evenly spaced, white teeth meeting in a scissors bite. The lower jaw is large and strong. The incisors are regularly aligned. Disqualifications: Overshot or undershot bite that is accentuated or disfiguring. The dark nose is fully pigmented. Disqualification: Dudley nose or nose partially depigmented. The eyes are large, slightly oval, and set just slightly obliquely. Eye color is dark chestnut, with the darkness of the color varying with the color of the coat. The eye rims are tight-fitting and black. The eyelashes are particularly long so they can lift the hair that falls over the eyes. The expression is attentive and calm. Disqualifications: Total bilateral depigmentation of the eyelids; bilateral cross-eyes; wall eyes. The ears are soft and thin, and hang down on either side of the face. The ears are set on high. At its widest point, the ear is from 21/2 to 3 inches wide. Ear length does not exceed half the length of the head, and shorter is preferred. The top two-thirds of the ear is triangular in shape, with slightly rounded tips. When the dog is alert, the ears prick up at the base, with the top two-thirds semi-drooping. Viewed from the side, the ears appear to be an extension of the curve of the back of the neck. The ears are covered with soft, slightly wavy hair, forming fringes at the tip",

			"neck": "The neck is strong, slightly arched, and, measured from the nape to the forward edge of the withers, should be about 20 percent shorter than the length of the head. In its center, the perimeter of the neck must be at least twice its length. There is no dewlap. The hair on the neck must be dense",

			"forequarters": "The shoulders are massive and strong. The shoulder blade is about 6 to 63/4 inches long and is moderately laid back, about 50 degrees from the horizontal. The shoulder blades should be tightly knit. The upper arm is just slightly longer than the scapula, about 7 inches. The angle formed by the scapula and upper arm varies between 105 and 125 degrees. The vertical forearm is about the same length as the upper arm and is placed so that the point of the elbow is on a vertical line falling from the tops of the scapulae. The elbows are neither close to the body nor out, but are set on a plane parallel to the body. The wrist follows the vertical line of the forearm and is very mobile. The pisiform bone protrudes. The pasterns are straight when viewed from the front, and slightly sloping when viewed from the side",

			"body": "The Bergamasco is square, with the length of body measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks equal to the height measured at the withers. Permitted, but not desirable, is a slight margin of tolerance which in no case must be more than 3/4 (three-quarters) of an inch. The ribs are well-sprung and let down to the elbows. The depth of the rib cage is equal to half the dog's height at the withers. The line of the back inclines very slightly downward from prominent withers to a strong, broad back with a straight upper line. The loin is well-muscled and broad. The croup is slightly sloping, about 30 degrees downward from the horizontal. Tuck-up is nearly absent",

			"hindquarters": "The upper thigh is long, wide and well muscled. The angle formed between the pelvis and the upper thigh is approximately 105 degrees. The lower thigh is as long as the upper, with strong bone and lean muscles. It slopes downward and backward, forming a moderate angle of about 135 degrees at the stifle. There is a well-defined furrow between the tendon and the bone above the hock. The distance from the point of hock to the ground is no less than 25 percent of the height at the withers. Viewed from behind, the rear pasterns should be vertical and parallel to one another. Viewed from the side, the rear pasterns are vertical and placed so that the hocks just slightly extend past a vertical line dropped from the point of buttock. The angle of the hock joint is about 140-145 degrees",

			"feet": "The feet are oval, with toes well knit and arched. The pads of the feet are tough and dark. The toenails are strong and black. The feet are well feathered with hair, including between the toes. Front and rear dewclaws must be removed",

			"tail": "The tail is set on in the last third of the croup. The tail is uncut, thick at the base, and tapering to the tip. When the dog is in repose, the tail just reaches to the hock, and is carried in saber fashion, with a curve in the lower third. When the dog is in action the tail waves like a flag. Disqualifications: No tail. Stump tail. Tail rolled over the back. "note": "The "size": "and aesthetic characteristics indicated are the general goals of most breeders and may vary among the breed",

			"character": "Strong, sound and brave, the Bergamasco is above all intelligent and balanced. Bergamasco is a peaceful dog. Attentive and reserved, it participates constantly in everything going on around it. The Bergamasco is an excellent watch dog because it doesn't like strangers invading the world of its keep. Its relationship with children is something special. Their presence awakens its most profound and primitive instincts; patient, tolerant, attentive and protective, it seeks their company, encouraging their games, and establishes true friendships with them. The Bergamasco is both a watch and guard dog and will alert when other people come to the home; however, the Bergamasco is not aggressive as long as the visitors pose no threat to the family. Bergamascos are usually okay with other dogs as long as the other dogs do not challenge them or appear as a threat. They will usually do okay with cats, but it is best if they were raised together. 

			"care": "The Bergamasco is not a dog for everyone, but with the right owner, they are truly a pleasure to own. The Bergamasco needs an owner who provides leadership over the dog. Not harsh, but calm and firm, setting rules the dog must follow and being consistent about enforcing them. This is not a dog for the meek or passive owner",

			"exercise": "The Bergamasco enjoys the outdoors and will exercise on their own accord if they live and work on a large farm. The Bergamasco Sheepdog is best suited for seasonal to cold Climates. Given their dense coat which provides protection from the elements of the climate, it is not uncommon to find the Bergamasco spending their nights sleeping outdoors. A long daily walk, herding the sheep or a romp with the kids is ample exercise that is necessary for a Happy Bergamasco. The Bergamasco sheepdog would not do well in apartment living",

			"health": "Usually a very healthy breed. Average lifespan: about 13-15 years"

Do not expect too much by way of obedience from this dog - they are naturally gently animals but they do have minds of their own and will often make their own decisions rather than following your order.

				"care": "The Cesky should be trimmed regularly, leaving the hair long on the stomach and legs and around the face(moustache, beard, and eyebrows). If the dog is a pet, it will need to be trimmed about four times a year; dogs for showing require more frequent grooming. The longer hair needs to be brushed or combed twice a week or more, depending upon the condition of the coat to prevent tangles.

				"training": "This breed is not recommended for the inexperienced new dog owner. The handler needs to be consistent and to exude authority because these dogs like to have their own way. They are less gentle than many breeds, for example the Golden Retriever. A consistent but kind approach is the most successful way to handle these dogs. Attend an obedience class with this dog. They are usually slow to mature. 

				"social": "This dog will get along perfectly well with a cat that is already present in the house, but may chase other cats. The dogs in particular can behave dominantly toward other males, although this may depend upon their social training. Take the young dog out with you as often as possible and introduce it to other dogs so that it has the chance to feel relaxed with them. Chesapeake Bay Retrievers get on extremely well with children but are somewhat reserved toward strangers. 

				"exercise": "This breed needs lots of exercise. If they do not get it, they may become badly behaved from simple boredom. Swimming and retrieving are two activities which they greatly enjoy. They also like field sports. They are, however, somewhat slow learners",

The other type is known as the Powder Puff. This type has an undercoat and a veil-like topcoat of silken hair. Any color is acceptable. These two varieties are interbred with each other. 

				"care": "The skin of the Chinese Crested requires careful attention. Those with show dogs wash the skin regularly with skin exfoliating creams made for humans to remove the dead cells and to soften the skin. The important point is for the skin to be supple and smooth and protected against becoming dry. There are excellent lotions and creams for this purpose. The unpigmented areas of the dog's skin are especially sensitive to the sun and it is advisable to either keep the dog out of the sun entirely or to use a good quality sunscreen on it.

Usually these dogs have the hair on the face clipped to form downward- facing points to achieve the typical style of this type of dog.

They are not, however, a good ideal choice of dog if you have cats or other small animals because they have strong hunting instincts which make them chase anything which suddenly moves and they cannot resist that instinct. 

				"exercise": "If these dogs have the freedom of a fair-sized piece of ground which is well fenced in, an outing twice a week with the bicycle for a chance of background will be sufficient.

Two other colors are accepted in some countries. These are the Mantle which has a black coat covering almost all the dog with white showing on just the chest, neck, blaze, belly, legs and tip of the tail; and another variety where this mantle is broken with white. Both are considered as black in some countries. The different colors are not interbred",

				"care": "The Great Dane’s coat requires very little attention. During shedding it is best to remove dead and loose hairs with a rubber brush. The Great Dane must always be allowed to lie somewhere soft to avoid pressure marks. Fast growing breeds like the Great Dane require care during the growing stage. The first essential is the right nutrition. The other point to watch is to limit exercise, avoiding pressuring and overtiring the dog which can cause serious problems for the developing bones, joints and muscles. These dogs do not belong in a kennel and like to be comfortable",

				"character": "These are affectionate, calm, and intelligent dogs that are sensible, sensitive, very loyal to the handler and family, not easily led astray by bribes, and are curious. Despite that fact that they do not bark much, these dogs make excellent watchdogs. It is said that a burglar may get into a house watched over by a Great Dane but can never get out. Like other Mastiff types, the Great Dane is not very susceptible to pain and so it is possible that an illness or injury may be overlooked for some time",

				"training": "The Great Dane grows in a very short period into a very large dog. You must therefore teach it as a very young dog that it must not pull on the leash. Train it with understanding and with great consistency. These dogs are very sensitive to the intonation of the voice and your friendly request will quite often be sufficient to get them to do what you require",

				"social": "Generally Great Danes get on perfectly well with their own kind, other household pets, and children. Most of them are rather unsure with strangers but friends of the family will be warmly greeted",

				"exercise": "These strong and elegant dogs require a great deal of exercise. They will enjoy being able to run free and romping, of the leash, in open country o woodland. They can also exercise running alongside a bicycle provided they stray strictly by you. Great Danes that get sufficient outdoor exercise will be very peaceful indoors"

				"training": "Even though this breed bonds closely with the family of which they form a part, they are not a suitable breed for everyone. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog has a very strong character and needs a handler who is equally strong. It must get the chance to grow up in a well-balanced environment and have a clear understanding of what is permitted and what is not. It needs to be able to build a close bond with its family. Make sure that you are always consistent with it. A severe approach will only ruin the dog's nature. Watch and control it carefully during the growing stage so that all its energy can be used for building healthy bones and muscles. For the same reason be generous with its food",

Under your care it will make a marvelous friend for your children too, but do not forget that it will protect your children against their friends it is thinks they are being pestered by them.

        "care": "It is sufficient to groom the Greyhound occasionally with a soft brush. However, the ears should be checked regularly and the claws kept trimmed. These dogs are not suitable for living in an outdoor kennel because they are not reasonably resistant to the cold. Make sure that where they sleep is dry and draught-free",

        "training": "Compared with the other fleet-footed keen-eyed hunters, the Greyhound is reasonably easy to train. They can learn almost all commands and are fairly obedient except when they have set their eyes on prey. Then they will ignore all your commands. In some countries dogs of this entire group are not allowed out unless they remain on a leash, not just because of the danger they could present for wild animals but also the danger to themselves and road-users. 

        "social": "It is instinctive for these dogs to chase anything that moves quickly, which means that they are not really suitable companions for people with one or more cats. They seldom present difficulties with other dogs and are normally good with children. With strangers, they tend to be rather cautious",

         "exercise": "The dogs of this breed want to cover long distances running and walking. Consider joining a Greyhound racing association because the dogs can really express their natural selves on a race track. Trotting alongside a bicycle is a good alternative for working off the dog's energy. It does not really matter how the dog gets its exercise provided it gets enough",

				"care": "The Kerry Blue Terrier needs to be trimmed with scissors and a trimmer. In addition to this, they will need grooming occasionally with brush and comb. Dogs for showing will require higher levels of grooming. An advantage of the Kerry Blue is that it does not shed.

They can be stubborn, are hardy, have a mind of their own, and tend to be always ready for a fight with other dogs. They rarely bark unnecessarily. 

				"training": "Because this dog is active, self-confident, and stubborn, it needs a handler who is very confident. These dogs are not, therefore, suitable for beginners. The dog may want to attack other dogs in the street and obviously this must not be tolerated - even though it is a natural character trait of the breed.

Introduce it to cats and other household animals when very young so that it will get along with them when it is older. Some of them very much enjoy the company of other dogs, while others prefer to go through life as an "only dog", This seems to depend not so much on early social training as the personality of the individual dog. 

				"exercise": "The Kerry Blue is a sporty dog which likes to accompany its handler on long walks, but it will accept the occasional week without such a good outing. 

				"remarks": "The Kerry Blue Terrier is something special. Its coat is meant to look unkempt. If you want a dog which is not everybody's friend and which is also fairly unusual the Kerry Blue can be a good choice for you. Make sure you can be consistent and will value a dog which has its own distinct personality.

				"care": "This breed should never be brushed or combed since the felting of the coat is desirable feature. The felt is formed because the soft undercoat is not shed but catches in the tougher, and longer, outer hair. To encourage development of the felt strands, they can be teased by hand. Bathing is best left until summer, since it can take several days for the dog’s coat to dry.

Its training must be consistent and based upon mutual respect. The Komondor has an uncomplicated character and, once he understands your rules, will not overstep them. Despite its honest nature, the Komondor needs a confident handler. Because it will only obey an order if it makes sense to it, it is not suitable for obedience courses and similar activities. 

				"social": "The Komondor will get along fine with other animals and with children provided they are part of your household and family.

				"exercise": "It is possible to keep this breed in an urban environment although the country is more to its liking. If the Komondor is kept outdoors, it will naturally meet its own needs for exercise. This dog can be extremely lazy and will sleep and rest for hour upon hour.

The Maltese sheds little to no hair and is good for allergy sufferers",

Some may be difficult to feed due to digestion issues. They are sensitive to heat and cold, so prevent them from being chilled following baths or becoming over-heated in the summer. As with many small breeds, Maltese are prone to teeth problems; feeding dry dog biscuits in addition to their normal food can help the teeth stay clean and healthy. Average lifespan: 15 years

				"exercise": "For this dog to be happy it should be taken regularly for long walks. A walk around the block three times a day is definitely not enough. In a large enough fenced yard it will burn-off its energy itself. Because of its strong hunting instincts and dominant behaviour towards other dogs, an Argentinian Mastiff must be firmly controlled when walked on a leash. 

				"remarks": "This breed is banned in some countries. They are not suitable for beginners. Many of these dogs are deaf. Purchase puppies only for a trust worthy recognized breeder.

				"exercise": "This breed is ideally suited to defence dog, and security-training, and performs well in such competitions. It is important to take the dog for long walks to burn off its excess energy or find other ways of providing it with exercise.

"note": "The "size": "and aesthetic characteristics indicated are the general goals of most breeders and may vary among the breed",

				"character": "The Miniature Pinscher is more high-strung and has a stronger personality than the Standard Pinscher. They need firm, consistent training. Although the breed is not necessarily bad with children, much care must be taken in educating youths about proper handling and play. The dogs are relatively sturdy for their "size": "but can be easily injured by rough play with a child. In addition, their high-strung temperament leaves little patience for such rough play. Owners must take note to not 'spoil' these little dogs by allowing them to get away with dominant behaviours (pawing, jumping up on you, mouthing) or by being inconsistent with the house rules; in these circumstances, these dogs can become demanding, overly protective or aggressive. These dogs do best in a home with clear and consistent boundaries, rules and limitations; they strive to please their 'pack leaders' and will be loving, loyal companions",

				"care": "This is a very clean breed. Regular brushing is required. This breed is an average shedder",

				"exercise": "These little dogs will need lots of exercise EVERY day. The breed is a toy breed (AKC), however, these dogs' energy level exceeds the traditional concept or idea of the standard toy breed. Daily walks are required to reinforce this breed’s respect of their position in the pack, but not sufficient for this breed to wear off their excess energy. It is essential due to the energy level of this breed that a secured fenced yard be provided so they can have an outdoor area to run around in; it will need to be securely fenced in as these dogs are true escape artists. In addition, when in public this breed must be kept on a harness or leash, as it is natural for this breed to chase to anything that catches its eye. The true Miniature Pinscher, being a terrier, can go on the hunt at any moment, so this breed should be kept on-leash at all times when out for its walks. This dog truly does not see itself as small and therefore will challenge anything, including larger breeds. In addition, the dog can be quite destructive to homes if the dog is not allowed ample time to expel its natural energy that gets pent up when no secure yard is available. The breed is rated the 3rd worst breed for apartments due to overall high-level need for exercise as well as natural guarding instincts which lends the dog to barking and leads to many noise complaints",These dogs are only suitable for apartments if they have regular exercise. A daily 45 minute+ exercise regimen is a must in order to have this dog in an apartment",

				"health": "This breed is considered to be relatively healthy. Average lifespan is 15+ years.

				"skills": "The three breeds (Brussels Griffon/Griffon Bruxellois/ Brüsseler Griffon, Belgian Griffon/Griffon Belge and Petit Brabançon) all descend from a small rough-coated dog called a 'Smousje', which for centuries has been found in the Brussels area. These little dogs are very alert and were bred to guard carriages and keep stables free from rodents",

				"group": " F",C",I. Classification: Group 9: Companion and Toy Dogs; Section 3",2: Small Belgian Dogs – Petit Brabançon; #082; AKC: Toy Group

				"height": "(21 – 28 cm) See WEIGHT comments below",

				"weight": "(2",5 – 6 kg) A proper Griffon should be muscular, compact, and well-boned, and should not seem delicate, racy, or overly cobby. The Griffon often feels heavier than it is for such a small "size": ". Because they are judged by weight rather than by shoulder height, proper proportioning is essential to determine whether a dog is too fat, too slim, or too tall for its "size": ". "note": "These sizes are average; your dog can be smaller or bigger than average size,

				"coat": "The Petit Brabançon is short-coated. The hair is harsh, flat and gleaming, and at most 2 cm long. The following are the accepted colors: Black or black and tan. The tan markings must be pure and of a sustained color. They are present on the front legs, from foot to wrist, on the hind legs from foot to hock; up the inside of the legs; on the chest, on the cheeks, on the chin, above the eyes, inside the ears, below the tail and around the anus. The black can be mixed with red-brown, which is allowed although pure black and black and tan are preferred. Red, reddish; a little black (dark mask) is allowed on the head furnishing",. A few white hairs on the chest are tolerated but not sought after",

				"build": "All three breeds are sturdy toy dogs with thick-set, well-balanced bodies, giving a squared appearance in proportion when viewed from the side. Length of body, from point of shoulder to point of buttock should be as equal as possible to height at withers",

				"head": ": This is the most characteristic part of the body and the most striking. The head is quite large compared with the body and has an almost human expression",

				CRANIAL REGION : Broad and round. The forehead is well-rounded. Stop : Very pronounced",

				FACIAL REGION : Nose : Black. The nose is set at the same level as the eyes. Nose leather is broad with wide-open nostrils. The tip of the nose is tilted back so that in profile the chin, the nose and the forehead are on the same plane. Muzzle : The foreface including the nose is very short : it must not exceed 1",5 cm. For the Petit Brabançon a correct foreface appears longer because it has no furnishing. A poor expression is given by a non-turned-up foreface, just as it is by a nose whose top line lies below the line from the bottom of the eyes and these are both serious faults. Lips : Black. The top and bottom lips are in close contact and close-fitting. The upper lip does not form flews and does not overlap the lower lip. If it is too loose it spoils the desired expression. Jaws/teeth : The lower jaw is curved upwards, broad, non-pointed and jutting beyond the upper jaw; the breed is undershot. The incisors on each jaw are expected to be regularly set and in a straight line, with upper and lower remaining really parallel. The mouth must be tightly closed, showing neither teeth nor tongue. The width and prominence of the chin are extremely important. Care must be taken to ensure that no incisors are missing. Eyes : Well set apart, large and round, never bulging. Brown, as dark as possible. The eye is to be edged with black and preferably no white of eye is to be seen. Small, oval or light coloured eyes are a fault. Ears : Small, set high with enough space between them. Uncropped ears carried semi-erect and falling forwards. Ears which are too big are undesirable, so are ears falling on the side of the head. Cropped ears are pointed and erect. Cropped and uncropped ears are equally acceptable",

				"neck": ": Medium length; blends harmoniously into the shoulders",

				"body": ": The length of the body practically equals the height at the withers. The overall impression is of small square powerful dog. Withers : Slightly raised. Back : Straight, short, strong. Loins : Short and muscled, very slightly arched. Croup : Broad and flat or only very slightly sloping. Chest : Broad, well let down to elbows. The breastbone is well defined, which gives a slightly jutting chest in profile. Ribs well-sprung but not barrel nor too flat. Underline : Belly slightly tucked up; flanks clearly defined",

				"tail": ": Set high and carried quite high. A docked tail is shortened y 2/3 of its length. A non-docked tail is carried upwards with the tip towards the back without ever reaching it or being curled. A naturally short or broken or curly tail is a severe fault",

				LIMBS

				FOREQUARTERS: Overview : Front legs parallel with good bone, set sufficiently wide apart. Shoulders : Normal shoulder angulation. Elbows : Close to body. Wrists : Strong. Feet : Small, round, neither turning out nor in. Tight fitting toes; fused toes are undesirable. Thick pads as dark as possible. Nails preferably black, as dark as possible",

				"hindquarters": ": Overview : Hind legs with good bone, really parallel, angulated to balance with front legs. Stifles : Sufficient angulation. Hocks : Well let down, neither close nor open. Feet : See forequarters. Dewclaws not sought after",

				GAIT/MOVEMENT : Powerful, parallel movement of limbs with good rear drive. High-stepping front movement and ambling are faults",

				A proper Griffon should be muscular, compact, and well-boned, and should not seem delicate, racy, or overly cobby. The Griffon often feels heavier than it is for such a small "size": ". Because they are judged by weight rather than by shoulder height, proper proportioning is essential to determine whether a dog is too fat, too slim, or too tall for its size,

				ELIMINATING FAULTS : Temperament: Aggressive or overly shy. Nose lacking pigment or other than black. Tongue permanently visible, the mouth being closed. Wry lower jaw. Upper jaw protruding beyond lower jaw. Any other colours than those laid down in the standard, such as grey, blue and tan, brown and tan, liver colour. Any white patch.

				"character": "The Griffon Bruxellois is known to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with his or her master. They display a visible air of self-importance. A Griffon should not be shy or aggressive; however, they are very emotionally sensitive, and because of this, should be socialized carefully at a young age. Griffons should also be alert, inquisitive and interested in their surroundings. Griffons tend to bond with one human more than others. This, along with their small "size": . may make them unsuitable as a family pet, especially for a family with very small children. Griffons tend to get along well with other animals in the house, including cats, ferrets, and other dogs. However, they can get into trouble because they have no concept of their own relative "size": "and may attempt to dominate dogs much larger than themselves. Some say: "Having a Griffon means having a true constant companion. They need their favorite person all the time, and will be very unhappy if left outdoors or alone most of the day. A Griffon Bruxellois will want to follow you about the house, on your errands, and to bed",

				"care": "The Griffon sheds little to no hair and therefore need grooming on an as needed basis",

				"exercise": "These little dogs are very active indoors, however, like all dogs, they still need to be taken for a daily walk to fulfill a dog's primal instinct to walk",

				"health": "Prone to slipped stifle, eye (lens luxation and glaucoma) and respiratory problems. Due to their shortened snout, Griffons are very sensitive to the heat and should not be walked in extreme heat. Not the easiest whelpers, dams often require a cesarean section.

				"origin": "During the 19th century England, Ireland, and Scotland began to experiment with crosses between bulldogs and terriers, looking for a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog. The dog was bred first to bait bulls and bears. When baiting bulls was deemed inhumane, ratting (a sport where a number of rats were placed in a pit for a specified time with the dog) and dog fighting became more popular. Later the dogs became more commonly domesticated due to their loyalty, loving and gentle nature with their owners. In the United States, farmers and ranchers used this breed for protection, as catch dogs for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and to drive livestock. The breed was also used during World War I and World War II as a way of delivering messages on the battlefield. 

				"size": "The preferred shoulder-height is 45",7 to 48",4cm (18 to 19in) for males and 43",2 to 45",7(17 to 18in) for females", The correct relationship between height and weight is more important than these specific heights",

				"coat": "The coat of this dog is short and shiny. Colors include: brown; chocolate brindle; red-white red nose; chocolate red nose; chocolate and white red nose; chocolate red white tri-color; cocoa fawn red nose; red brindle black nose; mahogany and white brindle; sable brindle; black and tan; blue fawn; blue white; black; blue brindle, cinnamon, white and chocolate; red, white, fawn, black mask nose; brown brindle; black brindle; red white with black mask; dilute sable; and sable",

				"training": "The American Pit Bull is not suitable for anyone with little experience of dogs. These dogs must be taught when they are young not to pull on the leash because they are amazingly strong when fully grown. This breed can learn a great deal if well trained with a consistent approach. They often succeeded very well in obedience trials",

				"social": "These dogs can make good family dogs provided the family is always consistent and can cope with a boisterous dog. Enthusiasts for these dogs claim that they are loving with children. This dog will protect house and home and accept cats and other household animals provided it has become acquainted with them when young. Some examples of the breed can be rather eager to fight with other dogs",

It also requires grooming with brush and comb a number of times each week. Those dogs that are to be shown will require even greater levels of attention to their grooming. The longer hairs at the feet, on the belly, and around the face, give the Welsh Terrier is typical appearance. 

				"character": "The Welsh Terrier is a vigilant, active, cheerful and uncomplicated dog, which is affectionate and intelligent. Although it can sometimes try to dominate other dogs, it is brave, and obedient. It bonds very closely with its handler and family but is usually cautious with strangers. 

				"training": "The Welsh Terrier is bright enough to understand quickly what you want of it but is also cunning enough to try to divert you from your intentions. Give these dogs constant variety in their training and remain consistent towards them. 

				"social": "The Welsh Terrier can be rather reserved with people it doesn't know. It is usually patient with children and can withstand a bit of rough play. Make sure it becomes confident with cats and other animals of the house when it is young to prevent the dog from chasing them when it is older. 

				"exercise": "The Welsh Terrier is untiring; it is always ready to play with a ball and to run and gambol off the leash in the open countryside. On the other hand, if you occasionally find it impossible to spend this kind of time with your dog it will accept it without making a fuss",

				"country": "The Netherlands. 

				"skills": "Hunting dog, watchdog, farm dog, and family pet. 

				"size": "The Wetterhoun's coat is curly and oily. It must not be woolly. Accepted colors are plain black or brown, black and white, brown and white or brown roan. 

				"care": "Little grooming is required for the Wetterhoun. Comb the coat occasionally and check that the ears are clean. These dogs can live happily in an outdoor kennel provided they have sufficient contact with you and get their daily exercise. 

				"character": "This dog is physically very demanding of itself and can be sensitive. It is an intelligent, somewhat independent dog, often with a mind of its own. It is brave, reliable, and very vigilant. The Wetterhoun likes swimming. 

				"training": "This is not a suitable dog for the beginner. These dogs are intelligent and learn quickly but they are independent-minded enough to refuse your commands. A consistent but kind approach is absolutely essential. ",Depending upon the individual dog, corrective action may be appropriate. 

				"social": "For its own people the Wetterhoun is a good-natured and friendly dog - and this includes the children, provided they treat him properly. It's another story with strangers. In the case of strangers this dog is always cautious and ready to protect your home. Family friends, on the other hand, will get a hearty welcome. Other dogs and pets will be accepted without a murmur. 

				"exercise": "The Wetterhoun needs lots of exercise. The ideal situation for this dog is to have a large piece of land that it can run around on freely and which it will protect vigorously. This dog has no roaming instinct so it is unlikely to run away. 

				"remarks": "A Wetterhoun will pine away in an apartment in a busy urban area because these dogs are not suited to such a life. They are rarely seen outside their country of origin.

				"skills": "Historically a rat-catcher but nowadays usually a family pet. 

				"weight": "The weight is about 2 - 3kg (4 1/2 - 6 1/2 lb). 

				"coat": "This breed has very long, silk-like hair, colored golden-brown with steel grey. As puppies the grey hairs are black. 

				"care": "The Yorkshire Terrier needs intensive daily grooming with brush and comb. If you do not have the time or the inclination to do this, you should have the coat trimmed by a professional. The hair is normally kept out of the eyes with a rubber band or a ribbon tied in a bow. Show dogs' coats are usually protected to keep their condition by being rolled up on curling papers. Check the ears regularly and remove loose hairs from the ear passages. 

				"character": "This is a lively, intelligent, sometimes too-brave dog, which is loving, vigilant, and becomes attached to its family. Yorkshire Terriers are very alert and bark whenever they sense danger. 

				"training": "The Yorkshire Terrier is a fairly quick-learning pupil. Provided you are consistent in your approach and ensure the lessons are positive, enjoyable and varied, it will soon learn to obey. 

				"social": "Provided children do not treat them as a toy and do not invade their territory, these dogs will not cause any problems with them. Some of this breed can be rather foolhardy in their courage towards other dogs but usually get along very well with cats and other household animals. Strangers will always be announced by loud barking. 

				"exercise": "This breed adapts its exercise needs to the family circumstances and the dog can readily be kept in an apartment",

				"remarks": "The beautiful long hair of this breed is much admired at dog shows but to keep such a coat in good condition requires considerable work. Most Yorkshire Terriers which are kept as pets go through life with shorter clipped coats. Although purists may find this upsetting, it is better for the dog than an unkempt coat with tangles which hurt and bother the dog.
