			"Affenpinscher": {
				
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Germany.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Vermin destroyer, watchdog, and family pet.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is 25 – 30 cm (9 ¾ - 11 ¾ in).*

				COAT: The Affenpinscher has coarse hair which grows in whorls. The coat is usually plain black, but russet brown and grey markings are accepted.*

				CARE REQUIRED: It may be necessary to pluck the Affenpincher’s coat. This is usually done by a dog trimming specialist but it is possible to learn how to do it yourself. The hair should never be clipped because this ruins the coat for many years. Hairs sometimes grow in the corners of the eyes, causing irritation; these should be dealt with promptly.

				CHARACTER: Lively, cheerful, friendly, alert, dependent, and sharp-witted.

				TRAINING: Affenpinschers learn commands fairly quickly. Ensure consistency in the training but make sure there is ample variety in the drills so your dog will not become bored.

			"Afghan Hound": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Afghanistan/England.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Hunter by sight of large and small wild game, also watchdog, racing dog, and companion.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is 68-74cm (26 3/4-29 1/2in) for dogs and 63-69cm (24 3/4-27 1/4in) for bitches.*

				COAT: The Afghan Hound has a very long, fine coat. The hair on the face is short. Any color is accepted but the most common colors are red through shades of beige, often with a darker mask.*

				CARE REQUIRED: The grooming of the coat of these dogs requires a full hour, twice a week. The best method is to comb each handful of hair from the skin outwards so that no tangles can be overlooked, being careful not to break any of the hairs. Keep the ear passages clean.

				Afghans should be bathed about every two months, using a good quality dog shampoo which does not dry the skin. Grooming is so basic to the care of an Afghan Hound that no one should consider owning one who doesn't have the time to do it.

				CHARACTER: These are independent, proud, and noble dogs that are calm indoors but very active and fast outdoors. These intelligent animals are not slavishly obedient. They are brave, and vigilant, not noisy, and cautious with strangers. By instinct, they will chase anything that moves quickly. The males can try to dominate.

				TRAINING: These dogs are not suitable for inexperienced people. Their independent nature makes them difficult to train and they will never be totally and consistently obedient. Hitting or shouting at them lowers their respect for their handler. The best way to achieve anything with these dogs is to use a firm yet soft hand with them.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: The dogs can be rather dominant towards other males. They get along fine with children provided the dogs are not pestered by them and are left alone in their own territory. They are probably better for a family with older children. An existing cat will be accepted. Remember it is in their blood to chase anything that runs quickly.

				EXERCISE: The Afghan Hound needs lots of exercise. Try bicycling with the dog every day to give it the chance to get rid of its energy, but do not forget their hunting instinct. Only allow an Afghan to run freely off the leash where it cannot run off.

				SPECIAL REMARKS: A well groomed Afghan Hound is a marvelous sight and the dog knows it. This is a dog for the real enthusiast; you must appreciate its independent and sometimes unfathomable character.

				CHARACTER: The Airedale is tough on itself, loyal to its own people, but it can be stubborn. It tends to be playful, watchful, active, intelligent, and resolute. An Airedale does not often bark.

				TRAINING: The Airedale Terrier is intelligent enough to perceive quickly what is required of it. Try to give some variety to its training, because if it is asked to do the same thing over and over it is likely to refuse. Make the exercises a challenge. With the right handler, Airedale Terriers can do well in various dog sports including defense dog trials.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: In general, Airedale Terriers get on well with cats and other household animals, and they are very patient with children. They sometimes try to dominate other dogs, but this depends upon their training and the individual dog.

				EXERCISE: The Airedale Terrier has an average demand for exercise and will be happy with three walks around the neighborhood a day on the leash plus playing in the yard. Most of them love to play with a ball, swim, or retrieve objects, and once fully grown will happily run along.

			"Akbash Dog": {
			},

			"Akita (American)": {
			
				BREED NAMES: Akita, Akita Inu, Japanese Akita.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Japan.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Vermin destroyer and family pet.

				SIZE: The ideal shoulder-height is 67cm (26 1/4in) for dogs and 61cm (24in) for bitches. Variations of 3cm (1 1/4in) will be accepted.*
				COAT: The dog has straight, coarse covering hair with a soft dense undercoat. Permitted colors with the Japanese breed society are red, white, and streaked. A dark face is regarded in Japan as a fault. In some countries spotted and speckled dogs with a black face are permitted at shows.

				CARE REQUIRED: This breed is easy to care for. About twice a year they have a brief period of heavy shedding when a good comb with a double set of metal teeth should be used.

				CHARACTER: These are calm, thoughtful, intelligent, and friendly dogs which are reasonably obedient, imperturbable, and have a strong hunting instinct. They are good watchdogs but won't bark too much. But they can also be independent and try to dominate. They will become friends with their family but never very submissive.

				TRAINING: With a confident handler who is consistent in this approach, the Japanese Akita can learn a great deal. They do best if the training drills are not constantly repeated. They are not a suitable breed for beginners unless expert advice is followed very closely.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: Most Japanese Akitas have no time for other dogs and prefer not to have any other dogs for company. They virtually all tend to be extremely dominant with other dogs, especially ones of their own sex. They need to become acquainted with cats and other animals early in their lives to prevent later problems. They usually get on reasonably well with children, provided the children do not invade the dog's own territory. They should never be considered a children's playmate. Strangers will get a rather reserved reception from this dog.

				EXERCISE: Japanese Akitas have considerable stamina but if you miss a long walk one day, they will accept it without a fuss. Never forget that they have strong hunting instincts so if they are permitted to run free, there is a strong possibility they will run away.

				SPECIAL REMARKS: The Akita is highly revered in Japan and is viewed almost as a national icon.

			"Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog": {

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Watchdog and family pet.

				ORIGIN: The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog results from three generations of an old breeding program of PaPa Buck Lane of Rebecca, Georgia, USA. The program started back in the 1800's and was intended to rescue the "plantation dog" of Southern Georgia that was nearly extinct. This rare, bulldog-type guard dog descends from Buck Lane's dog, named Otto. Lana Lou speaks of her granddaddy as always having had an "Otto" about the estate. One Otto was all one needed since these Bulldogs were capable of guard work and woods work. When PaPa Buck was killed by a train in 1943, his Otto proved his undying devotion by constant visitation and guard duty over the grave. Buck Lane's granddaughter, Lana Lou Lane, continued the breeding program until she passed away in her sleep on July 20th 2001. Like the Plott Hound, this muscular breed is the creation of one American Family, and its survival depends upon the nurturing it receives. Originating from English Bulldog Stock, this dog's ancestors functioned as cattle and pig herders, but the Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is bred solely for security and companionship.

				SIZE: Height: 24 inches (61 cm.) Weight: Dogs up to 100 pounds (47 kg.) Females - about 78 pounds (34 kg.) There is a considerable difference between the males and females. Males can be almost twice as heavy as the smallest females.

				COAT: The coat of this dog is short and shiny.  Colors include; brown; chocolate brindle; red-white red nose; chocolate red nose; chocolate and white red nose; chocolate red white tri-color; cocoa fawn red nose; red brindle black nose; mahogany and white brindle; sable brindle; black and tan; blue fawn; blue white; black; blue brindle, cinnamon, white and chocolate; red white fawn black mask nose; brown brindle, black brindle; red white with black mask; dilute sable; and sable.

				CARE REQUIRED: Little grooming is needed. Occasionally comb and brush to remove dead hair and cut down on shedding. Bathe once every two weeks. This breed is an average shedder.

				CHARACTER: The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is a well-developed, exaggerated bulldog with a broad head and natural drop ears. The prominent muzzle is covered by loose upper lips. The prominent eyes are set well apart. The Alapaha's coat is relatively short and fairly stiff. Preferred colors are blue merle, brown merle, or red merle trimmed in white or chocolate & white. Also preferred are the glass eyes (blue), or marble eyes (brown and blue mixed in a single eye). The ears and tail are never trimmed or docked. The body is sturdy and very muscular. The well-muscled hips are narrower than the chest. The straight back is as long as the dog is high at the shoulders.

				TRAINING: The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is dutiful and quickly trainable. This breed is named as such for their streak of "royalty." It is a great watch and guard dog. They will fight to the death to defend their owners and make excellent companion dogs. Excellent with and protective of children. These are active, athletic and mindful dogs with a lot of heart. The objective in training this dog is to achieve a pack leader status. It is a natural instinct for a dog to have an order in their pack. When we humans live with dogs, we become their pack. The entire pack cooperates under a single leader. Lines are clearly defined. You and all other humans MUST be higher up in the order than the dog. That is the only way your relationship can be a complete success.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: These dogs can make good family dogs provided the family is always consistent and can cope with a boisterous dog. Enthusiasts for these dogs claim that they are loving with children. This dog will protect house and home and accept cats and other household animals provided it has become acquainted with them when young. Some examples of the breed can be rather eager to fight with other dogs.

				EXERCISE: Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldogs will do okay in an apartment if they are sufficiently exercised. The are very inactive indoors and will do best with at least an average-sized yard.

			"Alaskan Husky": {

			"Alaskan Malamute": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: North America (Alaska).

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Sled dog and family pet.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is about 64cm (25 1/4in) for dogs and about 58cm (22 3/4in) for bitches.*

				COAT: The Alaskan Malamute has a thick, coarse outer coat with a greasy and woolly under-coat. The normal colors are wolf-grey, or black with white - always with white on the stomach and a white face or top of the head. Other colors are permitted but white is the only plain solid which is accepted.*

				CARE REQUIRED: This breed's coat does not need much in the way of grooming. When it is shedding use a coarse comb with a double row of teeth to remove loose dead hairs.

				CHARACTER: This is an affectionate dog which is intelligent, friendly, loyal, and noble, but can have a mind of its own. It will never slavishly follow your whims. The Alaskan Malamute learns quite quickly and has tremendous stamina.

				TRAINING: Despite its friendly nature, this dog needs a firm hand in its training. The Malamute calls for a handler with plenty of confidence who understands the character of this dog. With such a handler these dogs can learn a great deal even including agility skills, although they will be outperformed in competition by one of the sheepdogs.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: Alaskan Malamutes generally get on well with children. They are friendly with everyone which makes them, of course, unsuitable as watchdogs. They can occasionally try to dominate other dogs of the same sex, but that's exceptional. If they have been introduced to cats when young there is no problem with them.

				EXERCISE: Exercise is probably the most important element in an Alaskan Malamute's life. This breed needs copious amounts of exercise. If at least an hour each day of hard exercise with this dog is impossible get another type of dog. In some places where there is no snow, there are sled dog organizations which arrange competitions these dogs can enter with a wheeled cart in place of a sled.. Malamutes are happy whether they are indoors or outdoors, but they do not like to be alone. Keep this dog on the leash whenever it is taken out because it may try to run away.

			"American Pit Bull Terrier": {
			
				SPECIAL SKILLS: Watchdog and family pet.

				ORIGIN: During the 19th century England, Ireland, and Scotland began to experiment with crosses between bulldogs and terriers, looking for a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog.  The dog was bred first to bait bulls and bears. When baiting bulls was deemed inhumane, ratting (a sport where a number of rats were placed in a pit for a specified time with the dog) and dog fighting became more popular. Later the dogs became more commonly domesticated due to their loyalty, loving and gentle nature with their owners.  In the United States, farmers and ranchers used this breed for protection, as catch dogs for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and to drive livestock. The breed was also used during World War I and World War II as a way of delivering messages on the battlefield. 

				SIZE: The preferred shoulder-height is 45.7 to 48.4cm (18 to 19in) for males and 43.2 to 45.7(17 to 18in) for females.* The correct relationship between height and weight is more important than these specific heights.

				COAT: The coat of this dog is short and shiny.  Colors include: brown; chocolate brindle; red-white red nose; chocolate red nose; chocolate and white red nose; chocolate red white tri-color; cocoa fawn red nose; red brindle black nose; mahogany and white brindle; sable brindle; black and tan; blue fawn; blue white; black; blue brindle, cinnamon, white and chocolate; red, white, fawn, black mask nose; brown brindle; black brindle; red white with black mask; dilute sable; and sable.

				CARE REQUIRED: Remove the dead and loose hairs from time to time with a rubber brush.

				CHARACTER: This is a brave dog which is loyal to its family, tenacious, and tough on itself. It makes a good watchdog, is boisterous with tremendous stamina, and tends to dominate other dogs.

				TRAINING: The American Pit Bull is not suitable for anyone with little experience of dogs. These dogs must be taught when they are young not to pull on the leash because they are amazingly strong when fully grown. This breed can learn a great deal if well trained with a consistent approach. They often succeeded very well in obedience trials.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: These dogs can make good family dogs provided the family is always consistent and can cope with a boisterous dog. Enthusiasts for these dogs claim that they are loving with children. This dog will protect house and home and accept cats and other household animals provided it has become acquainted with them when young. Some examples of the breed can be rather eager to fight with other dogs.

				EXERCISE: If you own an American Pit Bull Terrier make sure it gets plenty of exercise. These dogs like running alongside a bicycle and playing ball games; they also enjoy retrieving things.

			"American Staffordshire Terrier": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: United States of America.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Watchdog and family pet.

				ORIGIN: The early ancestors of this breed came from England, where applications included farm use, guarding, dog fighting, and companionship. Until the first part of the 19th century, the Bulldog was bred in England for the purpose of baiting bulls. Bulldogs pictured as late as 1870 resemble contemporary American Staffordshire Terriers to a greater degree than present-day Bulldogs. Some writers contend it was the White English Terrier, Fox Terrier, or the Black and Tan Terrier that was crossed with the Bulldog to develop the Staffordshire Terrier; all three breeds shared many traits, the greatest differences being in color, aggressiveness, and spirit. The cross of Bulldog and Terrier was called by several names, including Bull-and-Terrier Dog, Half and Half, and Pit Dog or Pit Bull terrier. Later, it assumed the name of Staffordshire Bull Terrier in England. These dogs began to find their way into America as early as 1870, where they became known as the Pit Dog and Pit Bull Terrier, then the American Bull Terrier, and still later as the Yankee Terrier.

				SIZE: The preferred shoulder-height is 45.7 - 48.4cm (18 - 19in) for dogs and 43.2 - 45.7(17 - 18in) for females. The correct relationship between height and weight is more important than these specific heights.*

				COAT: The coat of this dog is short and shiny. Any color is permitted, although black and tan, liver, plain white, or more than 80 percent white are less favored than broken red and beige with highlights, either with and without white patches.

				CARE REQUIRED: Remove the dead and loose hairs from time to time with a rubber brush.

				CHARACTER: This is a brave dog which is loyal to its family, tenacious, and tough on itself. It makes a good watchdog, is boisterous with tremendous stamina, and tends to dominate other dogs.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Hunting and family pet.

				ORIGIN: The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is also known as the Small French-English Hound and Petit Anglo-Francais. The breed was originated by crossing the older hounds of Anglo-French origin with the Harrier (Beagle) and Poitevin. The name "Petite Vénerie" does not mean that these dogs are small. It means they are used to hunt small game. In France, the country of its origin, this breed doesn't have a pet or show dog status but is rather used for its original purpose - hunting.

				SIZE: Height: 24 inches (61 cm.) Weight: Males up to 100 pounds (47 kg.)* Females - about 78 pounds (34 kg.)* There is a considerable difference between the males and females. Males can be almost twice as heavy as the smallest females.

				COAT: The coat is smooth and short. The possible colors are black and white, red and white, and tri-color. Very little grooming is required. Bathe once every two to three weeks.

				CARE REQUIRED: Little grooming is needed. Occasionally comb and brush to remove dead hair and cut down on shedding. Bathe once every two weeks. This breed is an average shedder.

				CHARACTER: The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is an athletic hound with well-defined musculature and good boning. The chest is deep and narrow, with well-sprung ribs. The topline is level. Compared to the body, the head is relatively small. The hanging ears are medium size. The nose can be either black or self-coloured (matching the coat colour). The eyes are dark. The front legs are straight. The back legs are strong and prepared for heavy thrusting action. The tail is carried cheerfully with a slight curve. The gait is energetic and well-balanced.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is an energetic and active dog. Due to their hunting nature, they are best suited for country and farm living rather than for city apartments, although the dog will do quite well if a large yard is provided. Being pack animals, they usually get along well with other dogs but had better be supervised with cats and other small animals. Gentle with children and they enjoy playing with them, but it is never wise to leave a small child unsupervised with the dog. The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is intelligent and responsive to training, though may be willful at times. Make sure to become a good pack leader and socialize the dog well.

				CARE REQUIRED: The coat of the Appenzell Mountain Dog requires little attention. Remove loose and dead hairs from time to time with a rubber brush.

				CHARACTER: The Appenzeller is a tough, sober, brave, intelligent, and lively dog which makes a good watchdog with a natural enthusiasm. These dogs do, however, like to bark so they are not suitable for areas with close neighbors.

				TRAINING: The Appenzell Mountain Dog responds best to an equable manner of training that is consistent in approach. Try to ensure that it makes acquaintance as positively as possible with all kinds of situations, people and other animals. This dog learns quite quickly, in part because it is so bright but also because it really wants to have something to do. This dog does not belong in a kennel. It likes to be outdoors, but only with its handler. Agility skill trials and games of catch and so forth are suitable sports for this breed.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: The Appenzell Mountain Dog usually gets along with other dogs and mixes well with livestock and household animals if it has become used to them when young. They are rather unsure of strangers but greet family friends effusively. A healthy and well brought up Appenzeller Sennenhund is fine with children. It is loyal to the whole family but tends to bond closely with one person.

				EXERCISE: A dog such as this does not belong in a busy urban environment or in the suburbs. It likes to be outdoors and is closely bonded with its territory. The dog's herding instincts keep it from running off. If the dog lives on a farm, it will get sufficient exercise on its own. In all other circumstances it must be taken on really long walks and if you can find work for it the dog will be completely happy.

			"Argentine Dogo": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Argentina.

				OTHER NAMES: Argentinian Mastiff, Dogo Argentino, Argentine Dogo

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Hunting dog.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is 60 –65cm (23 ½ - 25 ½ in).

				CARE REQUIRED: The coat of the Argentinian Mastiff is very easy to keep in condition. Remove dead and loose hairs during shedding with a rubber brush. Keep the claws short and, as is necessary with all dogs, make sure the ear passages are kept clean.

				CHARACTER: This brave, even-tempered dog is loyal to its handler and family, barks little, is demanding of itself, has considerable stamina, and a strongly developed hunting instinct. The dogs in particular may tend to try to dominate other dogs.

				TRAINING: This dog is definitely not a breed for beginners. It requires a well-balanced, loving, but very consistent upbringing. Try to reward it when things go well and when they go wrong punish the dog solely with your voice. A combination of isolation in a kennel with a tough training regime is cruel and can lead to unpredictable behavior from this dog.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: These dogs usually get on well with children although some of them can be rather boisterous. It is possible to socialize them to tolerate cats and other pets but it is not advisable to expect and Argentinian Mastiff to share a house with them. Remember that this is a hunting dog which will regard a cat or sheep as prey. They are not an ideal choice as watchdogs because of their hunting instincts although they are certainly likely to frighten away most wrongdoers.

				EXERCISE: For this dog to be happy it should be taken regularly for long walks. A walk around the block three times a day is definitely not enough. In a large enough fenced yard it will burn-off its energy itself. Because of its strong hunting instincts and dominant behavior towards other dogs, an Argentinian Mastiff must be firmly controlled when walked on a leash.

				SPECIAL REMARKS: This breed is banned in some countries. They are not suitable for beginners. Many of these dogs are deaf. Purchase puppies only for a trust worthy recognized breeder.

			"Australian Kelpie": {
			
				SPECIAL SKILLS: Australians can be very proud of the Australian Working Kelpie. It is one of Australia's truly national dogs. A kelpie is most valuable in the paddocks and yards, gathering a mob of sheep, driving them to the yards and pens and forcing the sheep through races, up ramps and into sheds and trucks. Always alert and watchful, the Kelpie is required to be an independent thinker, though will also rely on various whistle commands made by its owner. There are about half a dozen commands to which the Kelpie is trained to respond, each of these commands directing the dog to perform certain tasks. and family pet.

				ORIGIN: The ancestors of the Kelpie were simply (black) dogs, called Colleys or Collies. The word "collie" has the same root as "coal" and "collier (ship)".  Some of these collies were imported to Australia for stock work in the early 19th century, and were bred to other types of dogs (possibly including the occasional Dingo), but always with an eye to working sheep without direct supervision. Today's Collie breeds were not formed until about ten or 15 years after the Kelpie was established as a breed, with the first official Border Collie not brought to Australia until after Federation in 1901. Kelpies have been claimed to have some Dingo blood; as it was illegal to keep dingoes as pets, some dingo owners registered their animals as Kelpies or Kelpie crosses. Kelpies and dingoes are similar in conformation and colouring.

				SIZE: Working Kelpies stand about 50 centimetres (19.5 inches) at the withers for females, 55 centimetres (21.5 inches) for males, and weigh between 14 and 21 kilograms (31-46 pounds). Ears are pricked, but some dogs have one or both ears flopped; the tail will often follow the coat type, and will vary between smooth and bushy. The dog's working ability is unrelated to appearance, so stockmen looking for capable working dogs disregard the dog's appearance.*

				COAT: The working Kelpie comes in three coat types: smooth, short, and rough. The coat can be almost every colour from black through light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, and a few have white points. Kelpies sometimes have a double coat, which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. Agouti is not unusual, and can look like a double coat.

				CARE REQUIRED: This breed is easy to groom. An occasional combing and brushing is all that it needs. Bathe only when necessary as it will remove the natural oils in the weather-resistant coat and dry out the skin. This breed is an average shedder.

				The Australian Kelpie is a working dog that demands a great deal of exercise, preferably with some kind of job to do. Their energy levels are extremely high. They need to be taken on long daily walks. Makes an excellent jogging companion.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: Kelpies are loyal, friendly, intelligent, energetic dogs that require a challenging job to be satisfactory companions. They need to be stimulated, as idle and bored dogs become frustrated, noisy, and destructive. With personalised love and attention, they can be very placid and faithful, although they do need space to run. A working bred Kelpie must have a job to do and plenty of exercise and mental stimulation to remain healthy and companionable. A Kelpie is not aggressive towards people and cannot be considered a guard dog, though he will certainly bark when necessary. Working Kelpies may nip when working stock and should be taught early not to do so to humans. Working-bred Kelpies have done quite well in dog sports, search and rescue work, and can be good family dogs if they receive sufficient physical and mental exercise. The breed is unsuitable for a sedentary life and would not thrive in an apartment setting. Show Kelpies generally excel in agility trials and may be shown in conformation in Australia. 'Riley', an Australian Kelpie, set the world record for dog jumping when he jumped 2.95 metres at the Casterton, Victoria Kelpie Festival. In his previous 30 high jumping competitions he was defeated only twice.

			"Basenji": {

				CARE REQUIRED: Groom occasionally with a coarse rubber brush or with a rubber glove. These dogs naturally keep themselves very clean.

				CHARACTER: This remarkable breed acts in many ways like a cat. They clean themselves by licking their coat and do not bark instead making a sound that some say is like a yodel.

				COAT:  Bassets have a dense smooth short-haired.  The most usual color combination is brown, black, and white.  Other colors include red and white but almost any hound-coloring is permissible. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  There is little to the grooming of a Basset Hound.  Remove dead and loose hairs when the dog is shedding with a rubber glove.  Keep the ears clean by attending to them once a week, inside and out.  Keep the claws short and when necessary clean the folds of skin.  Do not give Bassets too many snacks as they have a tendency to become fat which is bad for them.  Dogs with drooping eyelids should be given drops, prescribed by the veterinarian, occasionally.  These dogs grow very rapidly when young and you must be sure they have a good nutritious and ample diet during this period.

				CHARACTER:  The Basset Hound has a mind of its own but is lovable, sociable, calm, playful, and patient.  It enjoys companionship, has a sense of humor and a real personality which can be influenced positively by its handler.  They have a very good scenting nose. 

				TRAINING:  These dogs tend to be quite independent so don't expect them to jump to your command.  A consistent approach with much patience can work wonders, though. Never wear out a young Basset by taking it on too long a walk.  Young dogs need all their energy to develop a strong body. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  These dogs make superb playmates for children and fortunately get along fine with their own kind and with other animals.  They are friendly towards strangers but if they sense danger they will bark loudly.  They do not like to be left alone.  If you know that it will be necessary to leave your dog along quite often, get two Basset Hounds so they will have each other for company.

				EXERCISE:  This breed does not require much exercise and will be quite content with three trots around the block each day provided they can also play in the yard.  Make sure your yard is adequately fenced because these dogs love to explore.

Remove excessive hair between the pads and keep the inside of the ears clean.  The hair of a Bearded Collie should be parted along the back. 

				CHARACTER:  The Bearded Collie is high spirited, cheerful and clever dog that is eager to learn, lovable, gentle, sociable and companionable, extremely independent, and active.  A Bearded Collie belongs to the family and should not be banished outdoors to a kennel.

				TRAINING:  The Bearded Collie is an intelligent dog who learns quickly.  Treating it severely during training does not work; you can achieve better results by a playful, soft-handed approach.  Give it ample praise and plenty of cheerful commands and avoid pressuring it, because that spoils its receptive and friendly disposition.

This breed usually performs well in obedience trials and agility competitions.

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat of the Beauceron does not require a great deal of attention.  An occasional grooming with more attention during the time when the dog is shedding is sufficient. 

				CHARACTER:  This dog is clever, attentive, active, intelligent, sometimes stubborn, and loyal to its owner and the family. It has considerable stamina and is very watchful. 

				TRAINING:  A consistent and loving upbringing with plenty of exercise and ample contact with its owner are indispensable for the well-balanced development of a young Beauceron.  If it is denied this it can become neurotic or aggressive.  The dog should get to know in a positive way many different people animals, things, and situations when it is still a puppy. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  A Beauceron that has been well socialized and brought up gets on fine under normal circumstances with children, and that also ensures that other dogs and pets will present no problems.

			"Bergamasco": {

			COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Northern Italy

			NAMES: Bergamo Shepherd Dog; Berger bergamasque ;Bergamaschi; Bergamasco; Bergamasker Hirtenhund; Bergamese Shepherd; Cane da Pastore Bergamasco

			SPECIAL SKILLS: This breed has been honed over hundreds of years to be the consummate shepherd, vigilant, determined, moderate, and patient; they would be left alone with hundreds of sheep to guide, guard and sort out the different and unexpected problems that would arise over the summer or winter season. The Bergamasco is also great with all children and have been used as therapy dogs for handicapped children.

			GROUP: F.C.I. Classification: Group 1: ; Section 1: ; #194

			HEIGHT AT WITHERS: Males: 22 ½ - 24 1/2 in (58 – 62 cm) Females: 21 – 23 in (54 – 58 cm)

			WEIGHT: Males: 70-84 pounds (32-38 kg.) Females: 57-71 pounds (26-32 kg.) Note: These sizes are average; your dog can be smaller or bigger than average size.

			COAT and COLORS: The Bergamasco’s characteristic feature is its unique coat. The coat forms “flocks” or loose mats, which cover the dog’s body and legs, and protect the dog from weather and predators. The Bergamasco coat is made up of three types of hair: undercoat, “goat hair,” and outer coat. The undercoat is short, dense, and of fine texture. It is oily to the touch and forms a waterproof layer against the skin. The “goat hair” is long, straight, and rough in texture. The outer coat is woolly and somewhat finer in texture than the “goat hair.” The “goat hair” and outer coat are not distributed evenly over the dog and it is this pattern of distribution that is responsible for the formation of the characteristic flocks. The coat from the withers down to the midpoint of the body is mostly “goat hair” which forms a smooth saddle in that region. On the back of the body and the legs, the woolly outer coat is abundant and mingles with the reduced quantity of “goat hair” in that region to form the flocks. The flocks are larger at the base than the end, flat, irregular in shape, and may sometimes open in a fan-shape. The hair on the legs also hangs in flocks rather than feathering. The flocks are never combed out. The hair on the head is mostly “goat hair” but is somewhat less rough in texture; it is typically long and hangs over the eyes. The acceptable colors for this breed are solid gray or with gray patches, all possible shades of gray (including shadings of isabella and fawn), up to and including solid black, provided it is not shiny or lustrous. Solid white is not allowed but white markings are acceptable if they cover no more than one-fifth of the coat.

			BUILD: The Bergamasco is a dog of medium size and rustic appearance. The body is compact and square in profile.

			HEAD The head is proportionate to the size of the dog, with the skull and muzzle of equal length, parallel to one another, and joined at a pronounced stop. The skin on the head is tight with no wrinkles. The skull is slightly domed between the ears, and rounded at the forehead. The skull is at most as wide as it is long, and features a prominent occiput and a marked median furrow. The depth and width of the muzzle, measured at midpoint, are each about half the length of the muzzle. The muzzle is blunt, tapering only slightly toward the nose. The lips are tight and of black pigment. They just cover the teeth. The inner corner of the mouth reaches back to a vertical line drawn down from the outside corner of the eye. The cheeks are not very prominent. Disqualifications: Bridge of muzzle decidedly convex or concave. The jaw is wide, with a full complement of strong, evenly spaced, white teeth meeting in a scissors bite. The lower jaw is large and strong. The incisors are regularly aligned. Disqualifications: Overshot or undershot bite that is accentuated or disfiguring. The dark nose is fully pigmented. Disqualification: Dudley nose or nose partially depigmented. The eyes are large, slightly oval, and set just slightly obliquely. Eye color is dark chestnut, with the darkness of the color varying with the color of the coat. The eye rims are tight-fitting and black. The eyelashes are particularly long so they can lift the hair that falls over the eyes. The expression is attentive and calm. Disqualifications: Total bilateral depigmentation of the eyelids; bilateral cross-eyes; wall eyes. The ears are soft and thin, and hang down on either side of the face. The ears are set on high. At its widest point, the ear is from 2½ to 3 inches wide. Ear length does not exceed half the length of the head, and shorter is preferred. The top two-thirds of the ear is triangular in shape, with slightly rounded tips. When the dog is alert, the ears prick up at the base, with the top two-thirds semi-drooping. Viewed from the side, the ears appear to be an extension of the curve of the back of the neck. The ears are covered with soft, slightly wavy hair, forming fringes at the tip.

			NECK The neck is strong, slightly arched, and, measured from the nape to the forward edge of the withers, should be about 20 percent shorter than the length of the head. In its center, the perimeter of the neck must be at least twice its length. There is no dewlap. The hair on the neck must be dense.

			FOREQUARTERS The shoulders are massive and strong. The shoulder blade is about 6 to 6¾ inches long and is moderately laid back, about 50 degrees from the horizontal. The shoulder blades should be tightly knit. The upper arm is just slightly longer than the scapula, about 7 inches. The angle formed by the scapula and upper arm varies between 105 and 125 degrees. The vertical forearm is about the same length as the upper arm and is placed so that the point of the elbow is on a vertical line falling from the tops of the scapulae. The elbows are neither close to the body nor out, but are set on a plane parallel to the body. The wrist follows the vertical line of the forearm and is very mobile. The pisiform bone protrudes. The pasterns are straight when viewed from the front, and slightly sloping when viewed from the side.

			BODY The Bergamasco is square, with the length of body measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks equal to the height measured at the withers. Permitted, but not desirable, is a slight margin of tolerance which in no case must be more than ¾ (three-quarters) of an inch. The ribs are well-sprung and let down to the elbows. The depth of the rib cage is equal to half the dog's height at the withers. The line of the back inclines very slightly downward from prominent withers to a strong, broad back with a straight upper line. The loin is well-muscled and broad. The croup is slightly sloping, about 30 degrees downward from the horizontal. Tuck-up is nearly absent.

			HINDQUARTERS The upper thigh is long, wide and well muscled. The angle formed between the pelvis and the upper thigh is approximately 105 degrees. The lower thigh is as long as the upper, with strong bone and lean muscles. It slopes downward and backward, forming a moderate angle of about 135 degrees at the stifle. There is a well-defined furrow between the tendon and the bone above the hock. The distance from the point of hock to the ground is no less than 25 percent of the height at the withers. Viewed from behind, the rear pasterns should be vertical and parallel to one another. Viewed from the side, the rear pasterns are vertical and placed so that the hocks just slightly extend past a vertical line dropped from the point of buttock. The angle of the hock joint is about 140-145 degrees.

			FEET The feet are oval, with toes well knit and arched. The pads of the feet are tough and dark. The toenails are strong and black. The feet are well feathered with hair, including between the toes. Front and rear dewclaws must be removed.

			TAIL The tail is set on in the last third of the croup. The tail is uncut, thick at the base, and tapering to the tip. When the dog is in repose, the tail just reaches to the hock, and is carried in saber fashion, with a curve in the lower third. When the dog is in action the tail waves like a flag. Disqualifications: No tail. Stump tail. Tail rolled over the back. * Note: The size and aesthetic characteristics indicated are the general goals of most breeders and may vary among the breed.

			CHARACTER: Strong, sound and brave, the Bergamasco is above all intelligent and balanced.  Bergamasco is a peaceful dog.  Attentive and reserved, it participates constantly in everything going on around it.  The Bergamasco is an excellent watch dog because it doesn't like strangers invading the world of its keep.  Its relationship with children is something special.  Their presence awakens its most profound and primitive instincts; patient, tolerant, attentive and protective, it seeks their company, encouraging their games, and establishes true friendships with them. The Bergamasco is both a watch and guard dog and will alert when other people come to the home; however, the Bergamasco is not aggressive as long as the visitors pose no threat to the family.  Bergamascos are usually okay with other dogs as long as the other dogs do not challenge them or appear as a threat.  They will usually do okay with cats, but it is best if they were raised together. 

			CARE REQUIRED: The Bergamasco is not a dog for everyone, but with the right owner, they are truly a pleasure to own. The Bergamasco needs an owner who provides leadership over the dog. Not harsh, but calm and firm, setting rules the dog must follow and being consistent about enforcing them. This is not a dog for the meek or passive owner.

			EXERCISE REQUIRED: The Bergamasco enjoys the outdoors and will exercise on their own accord if they live and work on a large farm.  The Bergamasco Sheepdog is best suited for seasonal to cold Climates.  Given their dense coat which provides protection from the elements of the climate, it is not uncommon to find the Bergamasco spending their nights sleeping outdoors.  A long daily walk, herding the sheep or a romp with the kids is ample exercise that is necessary for a Happy Bergamasco. The Bergamasco sheepdog would not do well in apartment living.

			HEALTH ISSUES: Usually a very healthy breed. Average lifespan: about 13-15 years.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  France.

				NAMES: Briard; Berger de Brie; Berger Briard; Chien Berger de Brie

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Herding dog, guard-dog and family pet.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 62 –68cm (24 ½ -26 ¾ in) for dogs and 56 – 64cm(22 – 25 ¼ in) for bitches.

				COAT:  The Briard has a long wavy coat of rather dry hair and a light undercoat.  All plain colors are permitted with the exception of white and chestnut.  The most usual colors are black and fawn.

				CARE REQUIRED:  Briards require weekly grooming with brush and comb.  The inside of the ears must be kept clean and any excessive hair in the ears should also be removed.  This is also true of the excessive hair which grows between the pads of their feet.

				CHARACTER:  Intelligent and prepared to work, tough, brave, alert, loyal, slightly dominant, and totally unsuitable for a life in a kennel.  The Briard has no sense of humor, so do not tease it.

				TRAINING:  Training of the Briard must be consistent, with much patience and love combined with a firm hand.  Severe, unjust training will have the same result as none at all.  With poor handling and training the Briard becomes withdrawn and even aggressive.  They are happiest in the house as part of the family.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  With the right handler the Briard blossoms as a first-class pet who can happily coexist with other pets.  They can be slightly aggressive towards other dogs.  Strangers are viewed with suspicion.

				EXERCISE:  This breed needs reasonable amounts of exercise.  This can be a simple country walk but swimming and running alongside a bicycle are also excellent forms of exercise for them.  They are ideally suited to defense dog/police dog trials.

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  In countries outside France the Briard will be a novelty who will protect you and your family; however, this is definitely not the dog for everyone.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Germany

				NAMES: German Shepherd; Berger Allemande; Alsatian, Deutscher Schäferhund

				SPECIAL SKILLS: German Shepherds are highly intelligent, agile and well-suited to active working environments, such as: police work, guarding, tracking, herding, search and rescue, therapy dogs, guide dogs for the blind, in the military, and in competitive obedience trials. German Shepherds also make loyal and loving pets inside the home. They enjoy being around people and other animals; socialization is critical for young puppies in order to prevent aggressive and dangerous behavior.

				GROUP: F.C.I. Classification: Group 01: Sheepdogs and Cattle Dogs; Section 01: #166, with working trial; AKC: Herding Group

				HEIGHT AT WITHERS: Males: 60 to 65 cm. (23.-25.5 in). Females: 55 to 60 cm. (21.7-23.6 in).

				WEIGHT: Dog: 30 to 41 kg. (66-90 lb).Bitch: 22 to 34 kg (48.6-75 lb).

				Note: These sizes are average; your dog can be smaller or bigger than average size.

				COAT and COLORS: The fur is a double-coat (an outer and under coat) and can be either short or long haired. The outer coat should be dense, straight and lie close to the body. On the head, inside of ears, on the front of the legs, and on the feet/toes, it should be short; it should be slightly longer on the neck and the rear of the thighs. Although the black and tan saddle may be most recognizable, German Shepherds come in a variety of colors and patterns though not all are desired. Two toned German Shepherds can be black and tan, black and red, black and brown, black and silver, black and cream, blue and tan, or liver and tan; always with the dark color forming a mask and a mantle. Solid colors may be black, white or any of the dilution genes (liver, blue, or cream). Dogs with coats that have tricolored hair (black and white with either brown or red) are called sable or agouti. Sables can come in a variety of mixtures as well, including black and silver, black and red, black and cream, and black and tan. Some various markings are referred to as 'striping' (black stripe markings on the legs found in some sables), "pencilling" (also often found on the sable as black lines on the top of the dog's toes), and “tar heels" (black that runs down the back of the dog's legs). A small, distinct white spot on the chest is acceptable. A light gray undercoat may be present.

				BUILD: The German Shepherd Dog is of medium size, slightly elongated, strong and well muscled, with dry bone and of firm overall structure. The length of the body is approximately 10-17 % longer than the height at the withers.

				Head: Wedge-shaped and cleanly chiseled. Not overly long, no coarseness. The length of the skull should equal that of the forehead. The stop should not be too pronounced; the muzzle should be wedge-shaped; the forehead should be rectangular; nose pigmentation should be black. The teeth should be strong and meet in a scissor bite. The lips should be close-fitting and darkly pigmented. The ears should be of medium sized; pointed; carried erect and turned forward with center line of each ear being parallel. The eyes should be almond-shaped eyes that slant slightly, never bulging; eye color should be as dark as possible.

				Body/Tail/Legs: Medium size with the length being slightly greater than the height. Solid, well-muscled. Solid bones. Strong, muscular neck without dewlap. Chest is well down and should descend below the elbow. Strongly developed back. Broad, strong loin. Long, slightly oblique croup. Back sloping gently from the withers and should merge with the tail. The tail should reach at least to the hock joint but not beyond the middle of the metatarsus; the hair is slightly longer on the underside; it is carried hanging in a gentle curve, though when excited, may be held higher but never above the horizontal. The front legs should be straight and parallel when seen from all sides. The shoulder blade and upper leg should be equal in length and at a 90 to 110’ angle to one another. The elbows lay flat against the body. The pastern should be 1/3 the length of the foreleg; the angle between the two should be 20 and 22’. The hindlegs are placed slightly behind the rear; seen from the rear, they are parallel to each other. Upper and lower thigh are approximately of equal length and form an angle of about 120°. The thighs are strong and well muscled. The hock joints are strong and firm. The metatarsus stands vertically under the hock joint. The feet are compact; the toes well arched forming a cat paw appearance; the pads and nails are darkly pigmented. * Note: The size and aesthetic characteristics indicated are the general goals of most breeders and may vary among the breed.

				CHARACTER: The German Shepherd is confident, alert, approachable, courageous, fearless, and unfailingly loyal dog, and has an excellent sense of smell. They are lively, eager, and highly trainable because of their intense desire to please their owners. In addition, the German Shepherd has an innate drive to protect the weakest members of their pack, be they the children or the most elderly persons in your home.

				CARE REQUIRED: Early training is vital. This breed does not like to be alone and cannot tolerate being closed inside all day. Brushing twice per week is required.

				EXERCISE REQUIRED: This is an active dog with a need for space and exercise, but can live in an apartment in the city if walked daily.

				HEALTH ISSUES: As is common of many large breeds, German Shepherds are susceptible to elbow and hip dysplasia. Other health problems sometimes occurring in the breed are von Willebrand's disease, skin allergies and canine degenerative myelopathy. It is also prudent to check the eye and ear health as GSD tend to have problems with these as well. German Shepherds, like all large bodied dogs, are also prone to bloat. They have an average lifespan of 10-15 years.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  France.

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hound (pack hound for hunting wild game) and family pet.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height of the smaller or Petit Basset Griffon is 34-38cm (13 1/2 - 15in) and38-42cm (15-16 1/2in) for the larger or Grand Basset Griffon.

				COAT:  The rough-haired coat is hard, not very long, and has a somewhat unkempt look.  These dogs are either single-colored, two-colored, or tri-colored.   The single color is grey-white or tawny; the two-colored are white with either grey, red, orange, or black patches; and the combination of three colors are either white-black-red, or white or tawny grey with a greyish white and red.  Single-colored drab red is considered undesirable.

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat required regular grooming with brush and comb.  Keep the ears, and especially the ear passages, clean.  File claws that become too long and clip any hair that becomes too long between the pads of the feet to prevent tangles.  About once a year pluck the loose and dead hair out by hand. If you wish to show the dog, the neck should be emphasized by removing hair from this area.  The breed standard requires the Petit Basset Griffin to have small ears and a tail which is accentuated by clipping excessive hair.

				CHARACTER:  These are high-spirited, lively, sociable, clever, loving, and sensitive dogs.  They have minds of their own but are quite straightforward.

				TRAINING:  As these dogs are quite independent there is no point in hoping to turn on of them into a perfectly obedient dog.  With the right approach, however, and with patience it is possible to train these dogs to a certain extent.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Dogs, pets, children and visitors are all accepted without problem - this dog seems to liketo have lots of people and animals around.

				EXERCISE:  Because these hounds need substantial amounts of exercise, it is necessary to take them for long walks regularly. In France they hunt in packs.  The larger Grand Basset Griffon is used to hunt for hares and roe deer, while the smaller Petit is used for rabbit hunts.  They usually adapt well to becoming family pets.  The coat required regular grooming with brush and comb.  Keep the ears, and especially the  ear passages, clean.  File claws that become too long and clip any hair that becomes too long between the pads of the feet to prevent tangles.  About once a year pluck the loose and dead hair out by hand.

				BREED NAMES: Old English Sheepdog, Bob Tail, Altenglischer Schaeferhund, Altenglischer Schäferhund .

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: England.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Sheepdog and family pet.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is a minimum of 60cm (23 ½ in) for males and 56cm (22in) for females.*

				COAT: The coat is luxuriant, rough, tough, and long with waterproof under-layer. Permitted colors are blue or different shades of grey. The head, neck, front quarters, and belly are white, with or without markings. White patches in the blue on the back are not permissible.

				CARE REQUIRED: These dogs require regular grooming: brush them thoroughly at least once a week, not overlooking the places where tangles form. When a dog is shedding it is possible to collect a half or even an entire garbage bag of hair. Keep the inside of the ears clean and remove both dirt and hair. The claws must be kept short so clip them regularly. Excessive hair between the pads of the feet should also be trimmed. For successful showing, the rear of the dog must be higher that the shoulders and this is sometimes accentuated for the show ring. Sometimes these dogs are trimmed, though unpopular with some purists, is better than a mass of tangled hair although it does seem strange that anyone would buy a long-haired dog and then have it clipped.

				CHARACTER: Intelligent, with considerable adaptability, amiable, social, not particularly alert, boisterous, uncomplicated nature, and likes to be part of the family.

				TRAINING: The breed needs gentle and consistent handling during training. It wants to please you and rarely displays dominant behavior, making it suitable for people with little experience with dogs. Because grooming is such an important a part of the general care for this breed, it is important to start brushing it when it is as young as possible. This prevents grooming degenerating into a wrestling match when it is much larger and stronger.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: The Old English Sheepdog get on exceptionally well with other animals and children. Visitors too will be greeted warmly.

				EXERCISE: This breed needs a fair amount of exercise but it will not misbehave if you miss a day if you are exceptionally busy. Most of the breed are crazy about playing with a ball and are well represented as competition in various sports.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Brussels, Belgium

				NAMES: Petit Brabançon, Small Brabant Griffon (Excepting for differences in coat and color, the Brussels Griffon, the Belgian Griffon and the Petit Brabancon have the same physical and temperament standards and are considered varieties of the same breed.)

				SPECIAL SKILLS: The three breeds (Brussels Griffon/Griffon Bruxellois/ Brüsseler Griffon, Belgian Griffon/Griffon Belge and Petit Brabançon) all descend from a small rough-coated dog called a “Smousje”, which for centuries has been found in the Brussels area. These little dogs are very alert and were bred to guard carriages and keep stables free from rodents.

				GROUP: F.C.I. Classification: Group 9: Companion and Toy Dogs; Section 3.2: Small Belgian Dogs – Petit Brabançon; #082; AKC: Toy Group

				HEIGHT AT WITHERS: (21 – 28 cm) See WEIGHT comments below.

				WEIGHT: (2.5 – 6 kg) A proper Griffon should be muscular, compact, and well-boned, and should not seem delicate, racy, or overly cobby. The Griffon often feels heavier than it is for such a small size. Because they are judged by weight rather than by shoulder height, proper proportioning is essential to determine whether a dog is too fat, too slim, or too tall for its size. Note: These sizes are average; your dog can be smaller or bigger than average size.

				COAT and COLORS: The Petit Brabançon is short-coated. The hair is harsh, flat and gleaming, and at most 2 cm long. The following are the accepted colors: Black or black and tan. The tan markings must be pure and of a sustained color. They are present on the front legs, from foot to wrist, on the hind legs from foot to hock; up the inside of the legs; on the chest, on the cheeks, on the chin, above the eyes, inside the ears, below the tail and around the anus. The black can be mixed with red-brown, which is allowed although pure black and black and tan are preferred. Red, reddish; a little black (dark mask) is allowed on the head furnishing.. A few white hairs on the chest are tolerated but not sought after.

				BUILD: All three breeds are sturdy toy dogs with thick-set, well-balanced bodies, giving a squared appearance in proportion when viewed from the side. Length of body, from point of shoulder to point of buttock should be as equal as possible to height at withers.

				HEAD : This is the most characteristic part of the body and the most striking. The head is quite large compared with the body and has an almost human expression.

				CRANIAL REGION : Broad and round. The forehead is well-rounded. Stop : Very pronounced.

				FACIAL REGION : Nose : Black. The nose is set at the same level as the eyes. Nose leather is broad with wide-open nostrils. The tip of the nose is tilted back so that in profile the chin, the nose and the forehead are on the same plane. Muzzle : The foreface including the nose is very short : it must not exceed 1.5 cm. For the Petit Brabançon a correct foreface appears longer because it has no furnishing. A poor expression is given by a non-turned-up foreface, just as it is by a nose whose top line lies below the line from the bottom of the eyes and these are both serious faults. Lips : Black. The top and bottom lips are in close contact and close-fitting. The upper lip does not form flews and does not overlap the lower lip. If it is too loose it spoils the desired expression. Jaws/teeth : The lower jaw is curved upwards, broad, non-pointed and jutting beyond the upper jaw; the breed is undershot. The incisors on each jaw are expected to be regularly set and in a straight line, with upper and lower remaining really parallel. The mouth must be tightly closed, showing neither teeth nor tongue. The width and prominence of the chin are extremely important. Care must be taken to ensure that no incisors are missing. Eyes : Well set apart, large and round, never bulging. Brown, as dark as possible. The eye is to be edged with black and preferably no white of eye is to be seen. Small, oval or light coloured eyes are a fault. Ears : Small, set high with enough space between them. Uncropped ears carried semi-erect and falling forwards. Ears which are too big are undesirable, so are ears falling on the side of the head. Cropped ears are pointed and erect. Cropped and uncropped ears are equally acceptable.

				NECK : Medium length; blends harmoniously into the shoulders.

				BODY : The length of the body practically equals the height at the withers. The overall impression is of small square powerful dog. Withers : Slightly raised. Back : Straight, short, strong. Loins : Short and muscled, very slightly arched. Croup : Broad and flat or only very slightly sloping. Chest : Broad, well let down to elbows. The breastbone is well defined, which gives a slightly jutting chest in profile. Ribs well-sprung but not barrel nor too flat. Underline : Belly slightly tucked up; flanks clearly defined.

				TAIL : Set high and carried quite high. A docked tail is shortened y 2/3 of its length. A non-docked tail is carried upwards with the tip towards the back without ever reaching it or being curled. A naturally short or broken or curly tail is a severe fault.

				LIMBS

				FOREQUARTERS: Overview : Front legs parallel with good bone, set sufficiently wide apart. Shoulders : Normal shoulder angulation. Elbows : Close to body. Wrists : Strong. Feet : Small, round, neither turning out nor in. Tight fitting toes; fused toes are undesirable. Thick pads as dark as possible. Nails preferably black, as dark as possible.

				HINDQUARTERS : Overview : Hind legs with good bone, really parallel, angulated to balance with front legs. Stifles : Sufficient angulation. Hocks : Well let down, neither close nor open. Feet : See forequarters. Dewclaws not sought after.

				GAIT/MOVEMENT : Powerful, parallel movement of limbs with good rear drive. High-stepping front movement and ambling are faults.

				A proper Griffon should be muscular, compact, and well-boned, and should not seem delicate, racy, or overly cobby. The Griffon often feels heavier than it is for such a small size. Because they are judged by weight rather than by shoulder height, proper proportioning is essential to determine whether a dog is too fat, too slim, or too tall for its size.

				ELIMINATING FAULTS : Temperament: Aggressive or overly shy. Nose lacking pigment or other than black. Tongue permanently visible, the mouth being closed. Wry lower jaw. Upper jaw protruding beyond lower jaw. Any other colours than those laid down in the standard, such as grey, blue and tan, brown and tan, liver colour. Any white patch. * Note: The size and aesthetic characteristics indicated are the general goals of most breeders and may vary among the breed.

				CHARACTER: The Griffon Bruxellois is known to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with his or her master. They display a visible air of self-importance. A Griffon should not be shy or aggressive; however, they are very emotionally sensitive, and because of this, should be socialized carefully at a young age. Griffons should also be alert, inquisitive and interested in their surroundings. Griffons tend to bond with one human more than others. This, along with their small size, may make them unsuitable as a family pet, especially for a family with very small children. Griffons tend to get along well with other animals in the house, including cats, ferrets, and other dogs. However, they can get into trouble because they have no concept of their own relative size and may attempt to dominate dogs much larger than themselves. Some say: "Having a Griffon means having a true constant companion. They need their favorite person all the time, and will be very unhappy if left outdoors or alone most of the day. A Griffon Bruxellois will want to follow you about the house, on your errands, and to bed."

				CARE REQUIRED: The Griffon sheds little to no hair and therefore need grooming on an as needed basis.

				EXERCISE REQUIRED: These little dogs are very active indoors, however, like all dogs, they still need to be taken for a daily walk to fulfill a dog's primal instinct to walk.

				HEALTH ISSUES: Prone to slipped stifle, eye (lens luxation and glaucoma) and respiratory problems. Due to their shortened snout, Griffons are very sensitive to the heat and should not be walked in extreme heat. Not the easiest whelpers, dams often require a cesarean section. Average lifespan is about 12-15 years.

				BUILD: The South Russian Shepherd Dog is a dog of above average size and robust constitution, a truly large and powerful breed. The breed is lean, but with massive bone structure and strongly developed musculature. Secondary sex characteristics are strongly marked, with the males being stronger, more massive and more courageous than the females.

				HEAD/NECK : Elongated shape with a moderately broad forehead; the occipital crest and the zygomatic arches are strongly pronounced. The stop should be barely visible. The eyes should have an oval shape, set horizontally, and dark; the eyelids should be darkly pigmented, lean, and fit close to the eye. The nose should be large and black. The teeth should meet in a scissor bite. The ears should be relatively small, of triangular shape, and hang down. The neck should be lean, muscular, of moderate length and set high on the withers.

This breed is known for its versatility. They have a multifaceted character, are playful and humorous, lively and active, and extremely faithful and devoted to his master and those over whom he watches. These dogs are protective, serious, reserved, and can become dominant if their owners are not strong pack leaders; they require firm and consistent training as they can be very independent and can have a short attention span. Given a dominant trainer/handler, this breed can do exceptionally wellDespite their size, they are flexible, quick, agile, obedient and teachable as a hunting dog. This dog must be socialized early to the different types of people and pets with which it will share its life.

				CARE REQUIRED: The long and thick coat need daily grooming. As with all dogs with furry hanging ears, weekly ear cleaning is recommended to prevent moisture build up and possible infections.

				EXERCISE REQUIRED: This breed is not suitable to apartment or city life. The possessive nature of this dog requires extensive property, a sizable family, and preferably other animals that it can protect.

				HEALTH ISSUES: South Russian Ovcharkas can become quite old. The age of 10 till 12 years is not an exception. In general they are healthy dog
