			"Affenpinscher": {
				
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Germany.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Vermin destroyer, watchdog, and family pet.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is 25 – 30 cm (9 ¾ - 11 ¾ in).*

				COAT: The Affenpinscher has coarse hair which grows in whorls. The coat is usually plain black, but russet brown and grey markings are accepted.*

				CARE REQUIRED: It may be necessary to pluck the Affenpincher’s coat. This is usually done by a dog trimming specialist but it is possible to learn how to do it yourself. The hair should never be clipped because this ruins the coat for many years. Hairs sometimes grow in the corners of the eyes, causing irritation; these should be dealt with promptly.

				CHARACTER: Lively, cheerful, friendly, alert, dependent, and sharp-witted.

				TRAINING: Affenpinschers learn commands fairly quickly. Ensure consistency in the training but make sure there is ample variety in the drills so your dog will not become bored.

			"Afghan Hound": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Afghanistan/England.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Hunter by sight of large and small wild game, also watchdog, racing dog, and companion.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is 68-74cm (26 3/4-29 1/2in) for dogs and 63-69cm (24 3/4-27 1/4in) for bitches.*

				COAT: The Afghan Hound has a very long, fine coat. The hair on the face is short. Any color is accepted but the most common colors are red through shades of beige, often with a darker mask.*

				CARE REQUIRED: The grooming of the coat of these dogs requires a full hour, twice a week. The best method is to comb each handful of hair from the skin outwards so that no tangles can be overlooked, being careful not to break any of the hairs. Keep the ear passages clean.

				Afghans should be bathed about every two months, using a good quality dog shampoo which does not dry the skin. Grooming is so basic to the care of an Afghan Hound that no one should consider owning one who doesn't have the time to do it.

				CHARACTER: These are independent, proud, and noble dogs that are calm indoors but very active and fast outdoors. These intelligent animals are not slavishly obedient. They are brave, and vigilant, not noisy, and cautious with strangers. By instinct, they will chase anything that moves quickly. The males can try to dominate.

				TRAINING: These dogs are not suitable for inexperienced people. Their independent nature makes them difficult to train and they will never be totally and consistently obedient. Hitting or shouting at them lowers their respect for their handler. The best way to achieve anything with these dogs is to use a firm yet soft hand with them.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: The dogs can be rather dominant towards other males. They get along fine with children provided the dogs are not pestered by them and are left alone in their own territory. They are probably better for a family with older children. An existing cat will be accepted. Remember it is in their blood to chase anything that runs quickly.

				EXERCISE: The Afghan Hound needs lots of exercise. Try bicycling with the dog every day to give it the chance to get rid of its energy, but do not forget their hunting instinct. Only allow an Afghan to run freely off the leash where it cannot run off.

				SPECIAL REMARKS: A well groomed Afghan Hound is a marvelous sight and the dog knows it. This is a dog for the real enthusiast; you must appreciate its independent and sometimes unfathomable character.

				CHARACTER: The Airedale is tough on itself, loyal to its own people, but it can be stubborn. It tends to be playful, watchful, active, intelligent, and resolute. An Airedale does not often bark.

				TRAINING: The Airedale Terrier is intelligent enough to perceive quickly what is required of it. Try to give some variety to its training, because if it is asked to do the same thing over and over it is likely to refuse. Make the exercises a challenge. With the right handler, Airedale Terriers can do well in various dog sports including defense dog trials.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: In general, Airedale Terriers get on well with cats and other household animals, and they are very patient with children. They sometimes try to dominate other dogs, but this depends upon their training and the individual dog.

				EXERCISE: The Airedale Terrier has an average demand for exercise and will be happy with three walks around the neighborhood a day on the leash plus playing in the yard. Most of them love to play with a ball, swim, or retrieve objects, and once fully grown will happily run along.

			"Akbash Dog": {
			},

			"Akita (American)": {
			
				BREED NAMES: Akita, Akita Inu, Japanese Akita.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Japan.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Vermin destroyer and family pet.

				SIZE: The ideal shoulder-height is 67cm (26 1/4in) for dogs and 61cm (24in) for bitches. Variations of 3cm (1 1/4in) will be accepted.*
				COAT: The dog has straight, coarse covering hair with a soft dense undercoat. Permitted colors with the Japanese breed society are red, white, and streaked. A dark face is regarded in Japan as a fault. In some countries spotted and speckled dogs with a black face are permitted at shows.

				CARE REQUIRED: This breed is easy to care for. About twice a year they have a brief period of heavy shedding when a good comb with a double set of metal teeth should be used.

				CHARACTER: These are calm, thoughtful, intelligent, and friendly dogs which are reasonably obedient, imperturbable, and have a strong hunting instinct. They are good watchdogs but won't bark too much. But they can also be independent and try to dominate. They will become friends with their family but never very submissive.

				TRAINING: With a confident handler who is consistent in this approach, the Japanese Akita can learn a great deal. They do best if the training drills are not constantly repeated. They are not a suitable breed for beginners unless expert advice is followed very closely.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: Most Japanese Akitas have no time for other dogs and prefer not to have any other dogs for company. They virtually all tend to be extremely dominant with other dogs, especially ones of their own sex. They need to become acquainted with cats and other animals early in their lives to prevent later problems. They usually get on reasonably well with children, provided the children do not invade the dog's own territory. They should never be considered a children's playmate. Strangers will get a rather reserved reception from this dog.

				EXERCISE: Japanese Akitas have considerable stamina but if you miss a long walk one day, they will accept it without a fuss. Never forget that they have strong hunting instincts so if they are permitted to run free, there is a strong possibility they will run away.

				SPECIAL REMARKS: The Akita is highly revered in Japan and is viewed almost as a national icon.

			"Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog": {

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Watchdog and family pet.

				ORIGIN: The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog results from three generations of an old breeding program of PaPa Buck Lane of Rebecca, Georgia, USA. The program started back in the 1800's and was intended to rescue the "plantation dog" of Southern Georgia that was nearly extinct. This rare, bulldog-type guard dog descends from Buck Lane's dog, named Otto. Lana Lou speaks of her granddaddy as always having had an "Otto" about the estate. One Otto was all one needed since these Bulldogs were capable of guard work and woods work. When PaPa Buck was killed by a train in 1943, his Otto proved his undying devotion by constant visitation and guard duty over the grave. Buck Lane's granddaughter, Lana Lou Lane, continued the breeding program until she passed away in her sleep on July 20th 2001. Like the Plott Hound, this muscular breed is the creation of one American Family, and its survival depends upon the nurturing it receives. Originating from English Bulldog Stock, this dog's ancestors functioned as cattle and pig herders, but the Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is bred solely for security and companionship.

				SIZE: Height: 24 inches (61 cm.) Weight: Dogs up to 100 pounds (47 kg.) Females - about 78 pounds (34 kg.) There is a considerable difference between the males and females. Males can be almost twice as heavy as the smallest females.

				COAT: The coat of this dog is short and shiny.  Colors include; brown; chocolate brindle; red-white red nose; chocolate red nose; chocolate and white red nose; chocolate red white tri-color; cocoa fawn red nose; red brindle black nose; mahogany and white brindle; sable brindle; black and tan; blue fawn; blue white; black; blue brindle, cinnamon, white and chocolate; red white fawn black mask nose; brown brindle, black brindle; red white with black mask; dilute sable; and sable.

				CARE REQUIRED: Little grooming is needed. Occasionally comb and brush to remove dead hair and cut down on shedding. Bathe once every two weeks. This breed is an average shedder.

				CHARACTER: The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is a well-developed, exaggerated bulldog with a broad head and natural drop ears. The prominent muzzle is covered by loose upper lips. The prominent eyes are set well apart. The Alapaha's coat is relatively short and fairly stiff. Preferred colors are blue merle, brown merle, or red merle trimmed in white or chocolate & white. Also preferred are the glass eyes (blue), or marble eyes (brown and blue mixed in a single eye). The ears and tail are never trimmed or docked. The body is sturdy and very muscular. The well-muscled hips are narrower than the chest. The straight back is as long as the dog is high at the shoulders.

				TRAINING: The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is dutiful and quickly trainable. This breed is named as such for their streak of "royalty." It is a great watch and guard dog. They will fight to the death to defend their owners and make excellent companion dogs. Excellent with and protective of children. These are active, athletic and mindful dogs with a lot of heart. The objective in training this dog is to achieve a pack leader status. It is a natural instinct for a dog to have an order in their pack. When we humans live with dogs, we become their pack. The entire pack cooperates under a single leader. Lines are clearly defined. You and all other humans MUST be higher up in the order than the dog. That is the only way your relationship can be a complete success.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: These dogs can make good family dogs provided the family is always consistent and can cope with a boisterous dog. Enthusiasts for these dogs claim that they are loving with children. This dog will protect house and home and accept cats and other household animals provided it has become acquainted with them when young. Some examples of the breed can be rather eager to fight with other dogs.

				EXERCISE: Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldogs will do okay in an apartment if they are sufficiently exercised. The are very inactive indoors and will do best with at least an average-sized yard.

			"Alaskan Husky": {

			"Alaskan Malamute": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: North America (Alaska).

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Sled dog and family pet.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is about 64cm (25 1/4in) for dogs and about 58cm (22 3/4in) for bitches.*

				COAT: The Alaskan Malamute has a thick, coarse outer coat with a greasy and woolly under-coat. The normal colors are wolf-grey, or black with white - always with white on the stomach and a white face or top of the head. Other colors are permitted but white is the only plain solid which is accepted.*

				CARE REQUIRED: This breed's coat does not need much in the way of grooming. When it is shedding use a coarse comb with a double row of teeth to remove loose dead hairs.

				CHARACTER: This is an affectionate dog which is intelligent, friendly, loyal, and noble, but can have a mind of its own. It will never slavishly follow your whims. The Alaskan Malamute learns quite quickly and has tremendous stamina.

				TRAINING: Despite its friendly nature, this dog needs a firm hand in its training. The Malamute calls for a handler with plenty of confidence who understands the character of this dog. With such a handler these dogs can learn a great deal even including agility skills, although they will be outperformed in competition by one of the sheepdogs.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: Alaskan Malamutes generally get on well with children. They are friendly with everyone which makes them, of course, unsuitable as watchdogs. They can occasionally try to dominate other dogs of the same sex, but that's exceptional. If they have been introduced to cats when young there is no problem with them.

				EXERCISE: Exercise is probably the most important element in an Alaskan Malamute's life. This breed needs copious amounts of exercise. If at least an hour each day of hard exercise with this dog is impossible get another type of dog. In some places where there is no snow, there are sled dog organizations which arrange competitions these dogs can enter with a wheeled cart in place of a sled.. Malamutes are happy whether they are indoors or outdoors, but they do not like to be alone. Keep this dog on the leash whenever it is taken out because it may try to run away.

			"American Pit Bull Terrier": {
			
				SPECIAL SKILLS: Watchdog and family pet.

				ORIGIN: During the 19th century England, Ireland, and Scotland began to experiment with crosses between bulldogs and terriers, looking for a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog.  The dog was bred first to bait bulls and bears. When baiting bulls was deemed inhumane, ratting (a sport where a number of rats were placed in a pit for a specified time with the dog) and dog fighting became more popular. Later the dogs became more commonly domesticated due to their loyalty, loving and gentle nature with their owners.  In the United States, farmers and ranchers used this breed for protection, as catch dogs for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and to drive livestock. The breed was also used during World War I and World War II as a way of delivering messages on the battlefield. 

				SIZE: The preferred shoulder-height is 45.7 to 48.4cm (18 to 19in) for males and 43.2 to 45.7(17 to 18in) for females.* The correct relationship between height and weight is more important than these specific heights.

				COAT: The coat of this dog is short and shiny.  Colors include: brown; chocolate brindle; red-white red nose; chocolate red nose; chocolate and white red nose; chocolate red white tri-color; cocoa fawn red nose; red brindle black nose; mahogany and white brindle; sable brindle; black and tan; blue fawn; blue white; black; blue brindle, cinnamon, white and chocolate; red, white, fawn, black mask nose; brown brindle; black brindle; red white with black mask; dilute sable; and sable.

				CARE REQUIRED: Remove the dead and loose hairs from time to time with a rubber brush.

				CHARACTER: This is a brave dog which is loyal to its family, tenacious, and tough on itself. It makes a good watchdog, is boisterous with tremendous stamina, and tends to dominate other dogs.

				TRAINING: The American Pit Bull is not suitable for anyone with little experience of dogs. These dogs must be taught when they are young not to pull on the leash because they are amazingly strong when fully grown. This breed can learn a great deal if well trained with a consistent approach. They often succeeded very well in obedience trials.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: These dogs can make good family dogs provided the family is always consistent and can cope with a boisterous dog. Enthusiasts for these dogs claim that they are loving with children. This dog will protect house and home and accept cats and other household animals provided it has become acquainted with them when young. Some examples of the breed can be rather eager to fight with other dogs.

				EXERCISE: If you own an American Pit Bull Terrier make sure it gets plenty of exercise. These dogs like running alongside a bicycle and playing ball games; they also enjoy retrieving things.

			"American Staffordshire Terrier": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: United States of America.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Watchdog and family pet.

				ORIGIN: The early ancestors of this breed came from England, where applications included farm use, guarding, dog fighting, and companionship. Until the first part of the 19th century, the Bulldog was bred in England for the purpose of baiting bulls. Bulldogs pictured as late as 1870 resemble contemporary American Staffordshire Terriers to a greater degree than present-day Bulldogs. Some writers contend it was the White English Terrier, Fox Terrier, or the Black and Tan Terrier that was crossed with the Bulldog to develop the Staffordshire Terrier; all three breeds shared many traits, the greatest differences being in color, aggressiveness, and spirit. The cross of Bulldog and Terrier was called by several names, including Bull-and-Terrier Dog, Half and Half, and Pit Dog or Pit Bull terrier. Later, it assumed the name of Staffordshire Bull Terrier in England. These dogs began to find their way into America as early as 1870, where they became known as the Pit Dog and Pit Bull Terrier, then the American Bull Terrier, and still later as the Yankee Terrier.

				SIZE: The preferred shoulder-height is 45.7 - 48.4cm (18 - 19in) for dogs and 43.2 - 45.7(17 - 18in) for females. The correct relationship between height and weight is more important than these specific heights.*

				COAT: The coat of this dog is short and shiny. Any color is permitted, although black and tan, liver, plain white, or more than 80 percent white are less favored than broken red and beige with highlights, either with and without white patches.

				CARE REQUIRED: Remove the dead and loose hairs from time to time with a rubber brush.

				CHARACTER: This is a brave dog which is loyal to its family, tenacious, and tough on itself. It makes a good watchdog, is boisterous with tremendous stamina, and tends to dominate other dogs.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Hunting and family pet.

				ORIGIN: The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is also known as the Small French-English Hound and Petit Anglo-Francais. The breed was originated by crossing the older hounds of Anglo-French origin with the Harrier (Beagle) and Poitevin. The name "Petite Vénerie" does not mean that these dogs are small. It means they are used to hunt small game. In France, the country of its origin, this breed doesn't have a pet or show dog status but is rather used for its original purpose - hunting.

				SIZE: Height: 24 inches (61 cm.) Weight: Males up to 100 pounds (47 kg.)* Females - about 78 pounds (34 kg.)* There is a considerable difference between the males and females. Males can be almost twice as heavy as the smallest females.

				COAT: The coat is smooth and short. The possible colors are black and white, red and white, and tri-color. Very little grooming is required. Bathe once every two to three weeks.

				CARE REQUIRED: Little grooming is needed. Occasionally comb and brush to remove dead hair and cut down on shedding. Bathe once every two weeks. This breed is an average shedder.

				CHARACTER: The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is an athletic hound with well-defined musculature and good boning. The chest is deep and narrow, with well-sprung ribs. The topline is level. Compared to the body, the head is relatively small. The hanging ears are medium size. The nose can be either black or self-coloured (matching the coat colour). The eyes are dark. The front legs are straight. The back legs are strong and prepared for heavy thrusting action. The tail is carried cheerfully with a slight curve. The gait is energetic and well-balanced.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is an energetic and active dog. Due to their hunting nature, they are best suited for country and farm living rather than for city apartments, although the dog will do quite well if a large yard is provided. Being pack animals, they usually get along well with other dogs but had better be supervised with cats and other small animals. Gentle with children and they enjoy playing with them, but it is never wise to leave a small child unsupervised with the dog. The Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie is intelligent and responsive to training, though may be willful at times. Make sure to become a good pack leader and socialize the dog well.

				CARE REQUIRED: The coat of the Appenzell Mountain Dog requires little attention. Remove loose and dead hairs from time to time with a rubber brush.

				CHARACTER: The Appenzeller is a tough, sober, brave, intelligent, and lively dog which makes a good watchdog with a natural enthusiasm. These dogs do, however, like to bark so they are not suitable for areas with close neighbors.

				TRAINING: The Appenzell Mountain Dog responds best to an equable manner of training that is consistent in approach. Try to ensure that it makes acquaintance as positively as possible with all kinds of situations, people and other animals. This dog learns quite quickly, in part because it is so bright but also because it really wants to have something to do. This dog does not belong in a kennel. It likes to be outdoors, but only with its handler. Agility skill trials and games of catch and so forth are suitable sports for this breed.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: The Appenzell Mountain Dog usually gets along with other dogs and mixes well with livestock and household animals if it has become used to them when young. They are rather unsure of strangers but greet family friends effusively. A healthy and well brought up Appenzeller Sennenhund is fine with children. It is loyal to the whole family but tends to bond closely with one person.

				EXERCISE: A dog such as this does not belong in a busy urban environment or in the suburbs. It likes to be outdoors and is closely bonded with its territory. The dog's herding instincts keep it from running off. If the dog lives on a farm, it will get sufficient exercise on its own. In all other circumstances it must be taken on really long walks and if you can find work for it the dog will be completely happy.

			"Argentine Dogo": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Argentina.

				OTHER NAMES: Argentinian Mastiff, Dogo Argentino, Argentine Dogo

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Hunting dog.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is 60 –65cm (23 ½ - 25 ½ in).

				CARE REQUIRED: The coat of the Argentinian Mastiff is very easy to keep in condition. Remove dead and loose hairs during shedding with a rubber brush. Keep the claws short and, as is necessary with all dogs, make sure the ear passages are kept clean.

				CHARACTER: This brave, even-tempered dog is loyal to its handler and family, barks little, is demanding of itself, has considerable stamina, and a strongly developed hunting instinct. The dogs in particular may tend to try to dominate other dogs.

				TRAINING: This dog is definitely not a breed for beginners. It requires a well-balanced, loving, but very consistent upbringing. Try to reward it when things go well and when they go wrong punish the dog solely with your voice. A combination of isolation in a kennel with a tough training regime is cruel and can lead to unpredictable behavior from this dog.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: These dogs usually get on well with children although some of them can be rather boisterous. It is possible to socialize them to tolerate cats and other pets but it is not advisable to expect and Argentinian Mastiff to share a house with them. Remember that this is a hunting dog which will regard a cat or sheep as prey. They are not an ideal choice as watchdogs because of their hunting instincts although they are certainly likely to frighten away most wrongdoers.

				EXERCISE: For this dog to be happy it should be taken regularly for long walks. A walk around the block three times a day is definitely not enough. In a large enough fenced yard it will burn-off its energy itself. Because of its strong hunting instincts and dominant behavior towards other dogs, an Argentinian Mastiff must be firmly controlled when walked on a leash.

				SPECIAL REMARKS: This breed is banned in some countries. They are not suitable for beginners. Many of these dogs are deaf. Purchase puppies only for a trust worthy recognized breeder.

			"Australian Kelpie": {
			
				SPECIAL SKILLS: Australians can be very proud of the Australian Working Kelpie. It is one of Australia's truly national dogs. A kelpie is most valuable in the paddocks and yards, gathering a mob of sheep, driving them to the yards and pens and forcing the sheep through races, up ramps and into sheds and trucks. Always alert and watchful, the Kelpie is required to be an independent thinker, though will also rely on various whistle commands made by its owner. There are about half a dozen commands to which the Kelpie is trained to respond, each of these commands directing the dog to perform certain tasks. and family pet.

				ORIGIN: The ancestors of the Kelpie were simply (black) dogs, called Colleys or Collies. The word "collie" has the same root as "coal" and "collier (ship)".  Some of these collies were imported to Australia for stock work in the early 19th century, and were bred to other types of dogs (possibly including the occasional Dingo), but always with an eye to working sheep without direct supervision. Today's Collie breeds were not formed until about ten or 15 years after the Kelpie was established as a breed, with the first official Border Collie not brought to Australia until after Federation in 1901. Kelpies have been claimed to have some Dingo blood; as it was illegal to keep dingoes as pets, some dingo owners registered their animals as Kelpies or Kelpie crosses. Kelpies and dingoes are similar in conformation and colouring.

				SIZE: Working Kelpies stand about 50 centimetres (19.5 inches) at the withers for females, 55 centimetres (21.5 inches) for males, and weigh between 14 and 21 kilograms (31-46 pounds). Ears are pricked, but some dogs have one or both ears flopped; the tail will often follow the coat type, and will vary between smooth and bushy. The dog's working ability is unrelated to appearance, so stockmen looking for capable working dogs disregard the dog's appearance.*

				COAT: The working Kelpie comes in three coat types: smooth, short, and rough. The coat can be almost every colour from black through light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, and a few have white points. Kelpies sometimes have a double coat, which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. Agouti is not unusual, and can look like a double coat.

				CARE REQUIRED: This breed is easy to groom. An occasional combing and brushing is all that it needs. Bathe only when necessary as it will remove the natural oils in the weather-resistant coat and dry out the skin. This breed is an average shedder.

				The Australian Kelpie is a working dog that demands a great deal of exercise, preferably with some kind of job to do. Their energy levels are extremely high. They need to be taken on long daily walks. Makes an excellent jogging companion.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: Kelpies are loyal, friendly, intelligent, energetic dogs that require a challenging job to be satisfactory companions. They need to be stimulated, as idle and bored dogs become frustrated, noisy, and destructive. With personalised love and attention, they can be very placid and faithful, although they do need space to run. A working bred Kelpie must have a job to do and plenty of exercise and mental stimulation to remain healthy and companionable. A Kelpie is not aggressive towards people and cannot be considered a guard dog, though he will certainly bark when necessary. Working Kelpies may nip when working stock and should be taught early not to do so to humans. Working-bred Kelpies have done quite well in dog sports, search and rescue work, and can be good family dogs if they receive sufficient physical and mental exercise. The breed is unsuitable for a sedentary life and would not thrive in an apartment setting. Show Kelpies generally excel in agility trials and may be shown in conformation in Australia. 'Riley', an Australian Kelpie, set the world record for dog jumping when he jumped 2.95 metres at the Casterton, Victoria Kelpie Festival. In his previous 30 high jumping competitions he was defeated only twice.

			"Basenji": {

				CARE REQUIRED: Groom occasionally with a coarse rubber brush or with a rubber glove. These dogs naturally keep themselves very clean.

				CHARACTER: This remarkable breed acts in many ways like a cat. They clean themselves by licking their coat and do not bark instead making a sound that some say is like a yodel.

				COAT:  Bassets have a dense smooth short-haired.  The most usual color combination is brown, black, and white.  Other colors include red and white but almost any hound-coloring is permissible. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  There is little to the grooming of a Basset Hound.  Remove dead and loose hairs when the dog is shedding with a rubber glove.  Keep the ears clean by attending to them once a week, inside and out.  Keep the claws short and when necessary clean the folds of skin.  Do not give Bassets too many snacks as they have a tendency to become fat which is bad for them.  Dogs with drooping eyelids should be given drops, prescribed by the veterinarian, occasionally.  These dogs grow very rapidly when young and you must be sure they have a good nutritious and ample diet during this period.

				CHARACTER:  The Basset Hound has a mind of its own but is lovable, sociable, calm, playful, and patient.  It enjoys companionship, has a sense of humor and a real personality which can be influenced positively by its handler.  They have a very good scenting nose. 

				TRAINING:  These dogs tend to be quite independent so don't expect them to jump to your command.  A consistent approach with much patience can work wonders, though. Never wear out a young Basset by taking it on too long a walk.  Young dogs need all their energy to develop a strong body. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  These dogs make superb playmates for children and fortunately get along fine with their own kind and with other animals.  They are friendly towards strangers but if they sense danger they will bark loudly.  They do not like to be left alone.  If you know that it will be necessary to leave your dog along quite often, get two Basset Hounds so they will have each other for company.

				EXERCISE:  This breed does not require much exercise and will be quite content with three trots around the block each day provided they can also play in the yard.  Make sure your yard is adequately fenced because these dogs love to explore.

				TRAINING:  The Bearded Collie is an intelligent dog who learns quickly.  Treating it severely during training does not work; you can achieve better results by a playful, soft-handed approach.

				CHARACTER:  This dog is clever, attentive, active, intelligent, sometimes stubborn, and loyal to its owner and the family. It has considerable stamina and is very watchful. 

				TRAINING:  A consistent and loving upbringing with plenty of exercise and ample contact with its owner are indispensable for the well-balanced development of a young Beauceron.  If it is denied this it can become neurotic or aggressive.  The dog should get to know in a positive way many different people animals, things, and situations when it is still a puppy. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  A Beauceron that has been well socialized and brought up gets on fine under normal circumstances with children, and that also ensures that other dogs and pets will present no problems.

			"Bergamasco": {

			COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Northern Italy

			NAMES: Bergamo Shepherd Dog; Berger bergamasque ;Bergamaschi; Bergamasco; Bergamasker Hirtenhund; Bergamese Shepherd; Cane da Pastore Bergamasco

			SPECIAL SKILLS: This breed has been honed over hundreds of years to be the consummate shepherd, vigilant, determined, moderate, and patient; they would be left alone with hundreds of sheep to guide, guard and sort out the different and unexpected problems that would arise over the summer or winter season. The Bergamasco is also great with all children and have been used as therapy dogs for handicapped children.

			GROUP: F.C.I. Classification: Group 1: ; Section 1: ; #194

			HEIGHT AT WITHERS: Males: 22 ½ - 24 1/2 in (58 – 62 cm) Females: 21 – 23 in (54 – 58 cm)

			WEIGHT: Males: 70-84 pounds (32-38 kg.) Females: 57-71 pounds (26-32 kg.) Note: These sizes are average; your dog can be smaller or bigger than average size.

			COAT and COLORS: The Bergamasco’s characteristic feature is its unique coat. The coat forms “flocks” or loose mats, which cover the dog’s body and legs, and protect the dog from weather and predators. The Bergamasco coat is made up of three types of hair: undercoat, “goat hair,” and outer coat. The undercoat is short, dense, and of fine texture. It is oily to the touch and forms a waterproof layer against the skin. The “goat hair” is long, straight, and rough in texture. The outer coat is woolly and somewhat finer in texture than the “goat hair.” The “goat hair” and outer coat are not distributed evenly over the dog and it is this pattern of distribution that is responsible for the formation of the characteristic flocks. The coat from the withers down to the midpoint of the body is mostly “goat hair” which forms a smooth saddle in that region. On the back of the body and the legs, the woolly outer coat is abundant and mingles with the reduced quantity of “goat hair” in that region to form the flocks. The flocks are larger at the base than the end, flat, irregular in shape, and may sometimes open in a fan-shape. The hair on the legs also hangs in flocks rather than feathering. The flocks are never combed out. The hair on the head is mostly “goat hair” but is somewhat less rough in texture; it is typically long and hangs over the eyes. The acceptable colors for this breed are solid gray or with gray patches, all possible shades of gray (including shadings of isabella and fawn), up to and including solid black, provided it is not shiny or lustrous. Solid white is not allowed but white markings are acceptable if they cover no more than one-fifth of the coat.

			BUILD: The Bergamasco is a dog of medium size and rustic appearance. The body is compact and square in profile.

			HEAD The head is proportionate to the size of the dog, with the skull and muzzle of equal length, parallel to one another, and joined at a pronounced stop. The skin on the head is tight with no wrinkles. The skull is slightly domed between the ears, and rounded at the forehead. The skull is at most as wide as it is long, and features a prominent occiput and a marked median furrow. The depth and width of the muzzle, measured at midpoint, are each about half the length of the muzzle. The muzzle is blunt, tapering only slightly toward the nose. The lips are tight and of black pigment. They just cover the teeth. The inner corner of the mouth reaches back to a vertical line drawn down from the outside corner of the eye. The cheeks are not very prominent. Disqualifications: Bridge of muzzle decidedly convex or concave. The jaw is wide, with a full complement of strong, evenly spaced, white teeth meeting in a scissors bite. The lower jaw is large and strong. The incisors are regularly aligned. Disqualifications: Overshot or undershot bite that is accentuated or disfiguring. The dark nose is fully pigmented. Disqualification: Dudley nose or nose partially depigmented. The eyes are large, slightly oval, and set just slightly obliquely. Eye color is dark chestnut, with the darkness of the color varying with the color of the coat. The eye rims are tight-fitting and black. The eyelashes are particularly long so they can lift the hair that falls over the eyes. The expression is attentive and calm. Disqualifications: Total bilateral depigmentation of the eyelids; bilateral cross-eyes; wall eyes. The ears are soft and thin, and hang down on either side of the face. The ears are set on high. At its widest point, the ear is from 2½ to 3 inches wide. Ear length does not exceed half the length of the head, and shorter is preferred. The top two-thirds of the ear is triangular in shape, with slightly rounded tips. When the dog is alert, the ears prick up at the base, with the top two-thirds semi-drooping. Viewed from the side, the ears appear to be an extension of the curve of the back of the neck. The ears are covered with soft, slightly wavy hair, forming fringes at the tip.

			NECK The neck is strong, slightly arched, and, measured from the nape to the forward edge of the withers, should be about 20 percent shorter than the length of the head. In its center, the perimeter of the neck must be at least twice its length. There is no dewlap. The hair on the neck must be dense.

			FOREQUARTERS The shoulders are massive and strong. The shoulder blade is about 6 to 6¾ inches long and is moderately laid back, about 50 degrees from the horizontal. The shoulder blades should be tightly knit. The upper arm is just slightly longer than the scapula, about 7 inches. The angle formed by the scapula and upper arm varies between 105 and 125 degrees. The vertical forearm is about the same length as the upper arm and is placed so that the point of the elbow is on a vertical line falling from the tops of the scapulae. The elbows are neither close to the body nor out, but are set on a plane parallel to the body. The wrist follows the vertical line of the forearm and is very mobile. The pisiform bone protrudes. The pasterns are straight when viewed from the front, and slightly sloping when viewed from the side.

			BODY The Bergamasco is square, with the length of body measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks equal to the height measured at the withers. Permitted, but not desirable, is a slight margin of tolerance which in no case must be more than ¾ (three-quarters) of an inch. The ribs are well-sprung and let down to the elbows. The depth of the rib cage is equal to half the dog's height at the withers. The line of the back inclines very slightly downward from prominent withers to a strong, broad back with a straight upper line. The loin is well-muscled and broad. The croup is slightly sloping, about 30 degrees downward from the horizontal. Tuck-up is nearly absent.

			HINDQUARTERS The upper thigh is long, wide and well muscled. The angle formed between the pelvis and the upper thigh is approximately 105 degrees. The lower thigh is as long as the upper, with strong bone and lean muscles. It slopes downward and backward, forming a moderate angle of about 135 degrees at the stifle. There is a well-defined furrow between the tendon and the bone above the hock. The distance from the point of hock to the ground is no less than 25 percent of the height at the withers. Viewed from behind, the rear pasterns should be vertical and parallel to one another. Viewed from the side, the rear pasterns are vertical and placed so that the hocks just slightly extend past a vertical line dropped from the point of buttock. The angle of the hock joint is about 140-145 degrees.

			FEET The feet are oval, with toes well knit and arched. The pads of the feet are tough and dark. The toenails are strong and black. The feet are well feathered with hair, including between the toes. Front and rear dewclaws must be removed.

			TAIL The tail is set on in the last third of the croup. The tail is uncut, thick at the base, and tapering to the tip. When the dog is in repose, the tail just reaches to the hock, and is carried in saber fashion, with a curve in the lower third. When the dog is in action the tail waves like a flag. Disqualifications: No tail. Stump tail. Tail rolled over the back. * Note: The size and aesthetic characteristics indicated are the general goals of most breeders and may vary among the breed.

			CHARACTER: Strong, sound and brave, the Bergamasco is above all intelligent and balanced.  Bergamasco is a peaceful dog.  Attentive and reserved, it participates constantly in everything going on around it.  The Bergamasco is an excellent watch dog because it doesn't like strangers invading the world of its keep.  Its relationship with children is something special.  Their presence awakens its most profound and primitive instincts; patient, tolerant, attentive and protective, it seeks their company, encouraging their games, and establishes true friendships with them. The Bergamasco is both a watch and guard dog and will alert when other people come to the home; however, the Bergamasco is not aggressive as long as the visitors pose no threat to the family.  Bergamascos are usually okay with other dogs as long as the other dogs do not challenge them or appear as a threat.  They will usually do okay with cats, but it is best if they were raised together. 

			CARE REQUIRED: The Bergamasco is not a dog for everyone, but with the right owner, they are truly a pleasure to own. The Bergamasco needs an owner who provides leadership over the dog. Not harsh, but calm and firm, setting rules the dog must follow and being consistent about enforcing them. This is not a dog for the meek or passive owner.

			EXERCISE REQUIRED: The Bergamasco enjoys the outdoors and will exercise on their own accord if they live and work on a large farm.  The Bergamasco Sheepdog is best suited for seasonal to cold Climates.  Given their dense coat which provides protection from the elements of the climate, it is not uncommon to find the Bergamasco spending their nights sleeping outdoors.  A long daily walk, herding the sheep or a romp with the kids is ample exercise that is necessary for a Happy Bergamasco. The Bergamasco sheepdog would not do well in apartment living.

			HEALTH ISSUES: Usually a very healthy breed. Average lifespan: about 13-15 years.

				COAT:  The silken coat consists of locks of spirally formed hairs.  There is no undercoat and the color is always pure white.

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat should be combed thoroughly every day.  Occasionally, the coat of this dog will need a professional clipping.  In common with other dogs with such coats, the Bichon Frise is clipped to a specific style which can vary from country to country.  To keep the coat white, it will be necessary to wash the dog regularly with a recognized dog shampoo.  Check at set intervals that the hairs around the eyes are not causing irritation and use the special lotion for this purpose to remove any tear stains.

			"Bloodhound": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Belgium.

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hound or tracking dog, and family pet.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 63-69cm (24 3/4 - 27 1/4 in) for dogs and 58 - 63cm (22 3/4 - 24 3/4 in) for bitches.

				COAT:  The Bloodhound has a short smooth coat.  The most usual colors are black and red, liver and red, and plain red.  A small amount of white on the chest, feet, and tip of the tail is permissible.

				CARE REQUIRED:  There is little to the grooming of a Bloodhound.  Brush them from time to time to removeloose and dead hairs.  More attention is necessary for the ears.  Check them for dirt to prevent infections and wash them occasionally (for example after the dog's ears have dropped into its dinner). The majority of dogs of this breed have drooping eye-lids.  If necessary administer eye-drops containing vitamin A.

				CHARACTER:  The dogs of this breed are gentle and affectionate, boisterous when young, friendly, tenacious, and independent.  They have a very loud bark but will bark no longer than necessary and they possess a very good scenting nose.  Once their interest is aroused by something, it is very difficult to get their attention to anything else.

				TRAINING:  The new owner of a Bloodhound will need to have plenty of patience and to possess great tact for training to succeed.  The most important consideration is to be consistent - these dogs know full well how successfully they can get around you with a pathetic look and make use of it to get their own way. Do not expect too much by way of obedience from this dog - they are naturally gently animals but they do have minds of their own and will often make their own decisions rather than following your order.  Do not overtire them with long walks until they are fully grown.  The Bloodhound is a big dog that grows rapidly and needs all its energy for developing strong bones, joints and muscles.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  The Bloodhound usually gets on well with children.  Make sure they do not pester the dog. These dogs are so good-natured that they will lie there and meekly let children clamber all over it which isn't fair to the dog.  Both wanted and unwanted visitors will be greeted happily because this dog seems to love company. They can live in harmony with other dogs and household pets.

				EXERCISE:  This breed has a phenomenal level of stamina and can walk for hours on end.  If you have one as a pet, you will have to do a fair bit of hiking quite frequently.  As is well known, they are primarily tracking dogs which means they encounter an interesting scent they will want to find its source.  Make sure that your yard is well fenced. Consider hunting with this hound or having it trained as a search dog.  They are resistant to cold and can be kept in kennel provided they get sufficient exercise and attention.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 25 - 30cm (9 3/4 - 11 3/4in) and the weight is 2.5 - 4kg (5 1/2 - 8 3/4lb). 

				COAT:  The coat, which is always white, consists of a mass of long erect locks.  There is no undercoat. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  Because the hair tangles easily, the coat should be combed out every day, especially on the belly, behind the ears, and between the legs.  These dogs need to be bathed regularly to keep the coat white.  One advantage of the coat is that it does not shed hair, but dead hairs should be removed by brushing.  Check the ears to ensure they are clean and free of any loose hairs.  When necessary, clip excess hair from between the pads of the feet.

				CHARACTER:  This is a cheerful, intelligent, and obedient dog that is very affectionate, clam, and vigilant. 

				TRAINING:  Since these dogs are anxious to please and find it easy to learn they are usually easy to train. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  The Bolognese gets on well with other dogs, pets, and children.  They want to be with their family all the time so should not be considered by a family which would need to leave them alone.  They are cautious towards strangers.  

				EXERCISE:  These dogs are satisfied with an average amount of exercise but greatly enjoy long walks when those are offered.

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  If the intensive grooming required for this breed can't be provided, choose another breed with coat that requires less attention.

				EXERCISE:  The idle Border Collie will become extremely badly behaved and even aggressive.  Physical exercise alone it not sufficient for this breed.  They want to work and must do so, with body and mind as one, carrying out different tasks.

They are perfectionists with a permanent will to please.  In brief, this breed lives for serving you day in day out.

				EXERCISE:  It has been said of the Border Terrier that it can keep a horse under control which may or may not be true.  It is true that these dogs love to run and play outdoors.  A Border Terrier restricted to three short outings per day and spending the rest of its time indoors will adapt to this life but at the expense of some of its natural zest for life.  Border Terriers are suitable for sports such as catch and playing with frisbees.  They also enjoy tests of agility.

				TRAINING:  The training of the breed has to be based upon mutual respect.  They really are not very obedient dogs but they can learn the basic requirements for living with you. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  These dogs do not like intrusive strangers.  They are noble animals that get on fairly well with children but they are certainly not playmates.

Its is advisable to train them socially with cats and other pets as young as possible, but they will always be hunters that and will race after a  fleeing animal.  

				EXERCISE:  Indoors the Borzoi can be so peaceful it might escape notice but outdoors it needs lots of  space to walk and run.  In some countries it is forbidden to allow all the dogs in this fleet-footed hunting category off the leash.

			"Bouvier de Ardennes": {
			},

			"Bouvier des Flanders": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Belgium.

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Historically a cattle driver, nowadays guard dog, defense dog, and family pet.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 62 – 68cm (24 ½ - 26 ¾ in) for dogs and 59 – 65cm (23 ¼ - 25 ½ in) for bitches.  The ideal shoulder height is 65cm (25 ½ in) for dogs and 62cm (24 ½ in) for bitches.

Plain black is not favored for showing but is permissible.  Blond Bouviers are not considered acceptable.

				CARE REQUIRED:  A Bouvier needs to be trimmed at least three times a year.  Between trims remove any excess hair inside the ears and time hair between the pads of the feet.  Do not let the hair grow too long close to the feet but trim it so that the Bouvier has nice round feet.  A well  groomed Bouvier sheds little hair in the home.

				CHARACTER:  The Bouvier des Flandres is very loyal and bonds well with both its handler and family.  This alert, brave, hardy, equable, and intelligent dog enjoys working and is sensible.

				TRAINING:  The Bouvier requires well-balanced training which remains consistent in nature.  It is important to make the dog aware, without being too hard with it, that you are and will remain the boss. This is an intelligent breed which learns new commands relatively fast though not quite as quickly as, for instance, a German Shepherd.  Once a Bouvier has learned something, it will remember it for the rest of its life.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Bouviers are generally sociable animals and provided they have been well socialized with cats when young, they get on well with other pets and their own kind.  Children and Bouviers generally form a good combination.  They regard strangers with suspicion and are very protective of their families.  Their loyalty is world-famous.

				EXERCISE:  This dog has an average demand for exercise.  It will enjoy going with you for a long walk or running alongside you while you bicycle.  During the growing stage exercise needs to be carefully regulated so that growing bones, joints and muscles are not too strenuously stressed.  The dog requires all its energy to build a frame.

			"Boxer": {		

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Germany.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is 53 – 63cm (21 –25in).

				COAT: The Boxer has a short smooth coat, either brindle or yellow, possibly with white markings and a dark face. The white should not cover more than a third of the dog.

				CHARACTER: This happy, friendly, spontaneous, and intelligent dog is eager to learn and curious. Learning quickly, it is also vigilant, boisterous, uncomplicated, straightforward, lively and constantly on the move, bonding very closely with the family.

				TRAINING: Teach the Boxer not to be so boisterous and especially not to jump up at people. Since it learns quickly and has substantial intelligence, the Boxer is ideal for various sporting activities from defense trials to skills trials.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: Boxers are known for the way they get on well with children. A well brought-up and properly socialized Boxer will also get on with his own kind and other household pets. The Boxer’s nature is to protect you, your family, and your home. Known visitors will be welcomed boisterously.

				EXERCISE: Try to give a Boxer plenty of exercise. When it has grown up, you can carefully let it run beside a bicycle. They love playing and romping with their own kind but a Boxer will happily leave its basket to play ball with you.

			"Boykin Spaniel": {

			"Bracco Italiano": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Italy. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Field sports dog and family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 58-67cm (22 3/4 - 26 1/4in) for dogs and 55 - 62cm (21 1/2 -24 1/2in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  The Bracco Italiano has a coat of short, dense, and shiny hair.  Permitted colors are white, white with large or small patches of orange, amber, or chestnut; and white with light orange or chestnut-brown mottling. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat of this dog does not require much attention.  When the dog is shedding you can remove dead and loose hairs by grooming with a rubber brush.  Keep its ear passages clean. 

				CHARACTER:  This is an equable and compliant dog which is intelligent, has a sense of humor, is thoughtful, gentle, calm in the house, affectionate, and sensitive. These dogs are not fully mature mentally until they are two and a half to three years old.  They are used as all-round field sports dogs for game birds.  

				TRAINING:  They need to be trained with a consistent but gently approach.  They are very sensitive to and react strongly to the sound of your voice.  Praise them if they do well.  When trained in the right way, they pick things up quickly.  Too tough an approach has an adverse effect which will achieve nothing except to lose the dog's respect for you.  Avoid over-taxing them physically during early growth and limit their going up and down stairs and steps as this can be harmful. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Bracco Italianos get along well with other dogs and do not usually cause any difficulties with other household animals.  They become close friends with children.  They will always go into action at the hint of danger. 

				EXERCISE:  It is important for this breed to get sufficient exercise.  These dogs are best living with a family which has a large yard - they are definitely not dogs for apartment living.  They love to swim and retrieve and once they are physically mature (at about 1/2 years), they can begin controlled exercise running alongside a bicycle.  As hunting dogs, they are considered sound workers with an outstanding scenting ability.

			"Brazilian Terrier": {
			},

			"Briard": 
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  France.

				NAMES: Briard; Berger de Brie; Berger Briard; Chien Berger de Brie

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Herding dog, guard-dog and family pet.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 62 –68cm (24 ½ -26 ¾ in) for dogs and 56 – 64cm(22 – 25 ¼ in) for bitches.

				COAT:  The Briard has a long wavy coat of rather dry hair and a light undercoat.  All plain colors are permitted with the exception of white and chestnut.  The most usual colors are black and fawn.

				CARE REQUIRED:  Briards require weekly grooming with brush and comb.  The inside of the ears must be kept clean and any excessive hair in the ears should also be removed.  This is also true of the excessive hair which grows between the pads of their feet.

				CHARACTER:  Intelligent and prepared to work, tough, brave, alert, loyal, slightly dominant, and totally unsuitable for a life in a kennel.  The Briard has no sense of humor, so do not tease it.

				TRAINING:  Training of the Briard must be consistent, with much patience and love combined with a firm hand.  Severe, unjust training will have the same result as none at all.  With poor handling and training the Briard becomes withdrawn and even aggressive.  They are happiest in the house as part of the family.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  With the right handler the Briard blossoms as a first-class pet who can happily coexist with other pets.  They can be slightly aggressive towards other dogs.  Strangers are viewed with suspicion.

				EXERCISE:  This breed needs reasonable amounts of exercise.  This can be a simple country walk but swimming and running alongside a bicycle are also excellent forms of exercise for them.  They are ideally suited to defense dog/police dog trials.

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  In countries outside France the Briard will be a novelty who will protect you and your family; however, this is definitely not the dog for everyone.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  England. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Family Pet.  

				SIZE:  There is no standard size for this dog; the most important point is for the build to create an impression of a substantial dog.  

				COAT:  The short-haired coat can be plain white, white with markings on the head, and or coloring broken with highlights.  Red, broken black, fawn and black and tan with a little white are all accepted.  With non-white animals, one color must predominate.  

				CARE REQUIRED:  A minimum of grooming is required for a Bull Terrier.  Brushing the coat with a rubber brush to remove dead and loose hairs to considered adequate to keep it in good condition.  In addition, you should regularly clean the ears.  These dogs need a soft place to lie down.  

				CHARACTER:  Bull Terriers can be hard on themselves (they seem to have almost no sensitivity to pain), and are affectionate but often stubborn and with a mind of their own, lively and boisterous, loving with children, spontaneous, and cheerful.  Some Bull Terriers are rather keen to fight other dogs.  

				TRAINING:  Take your puppy to a good obedience training course.  When fully grown, this dog is very strong for its size and it is very difficult to train when it is an adult.  The Bull Terrier is intelligent and learns relatively quickly, but it is also stubborn, with a mind of its own.  The handler needs plenty of patience but must also be consistent towards the dog, possess understanding and be able to express affection.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  This breed usually gets on well with children and, provided they have social training when young, will not present difficulties with cats or other household animals later.  Some Bull Terriers may try to dominate other dogs but this depends on the basic nature of the individual dog and the manner in which its social and other training was carried out.  If you already own a dog, don't but a Bull Terrier as a second dog.  It may take years before it happens, but sooner or later there will be a major battle between the two dogs.  

				EXERCISE:  When they get enough exercise, Bull Terriers are calm indoors.  These dogs enjoy running alongside your bicycle but don't try this until they are fully- grown, and even then not for too long at one session.  These dogs also like going for long walks and running and playing off the leash.

			"Bull Mastiff": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  England. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Watchdog and family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 63.5 – 68.5cm (25 – 27in) for dogs and 61 – 66cm (24 – 26in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  The coat is short and the colors, which may be streaked, are tan or red-brown, always with darker muzzle and ears.  A little white on the chest is permitted. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  Grooming a Bullmastiff is not difficult.  Occasionally remove dead and loose hairs with a rubber brush or massage glove. 

				TRAINING:  This breed reacts best to a fair, stable, and consistent approach carried out in a harmonious manner.  The Bullmastiff is very sensitive to the tone of your voice.  It is not a difficult dog but does require a handler who can assert this authority.  The Bullmastiff should never be banished to a kennel. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Bullmastiffs are very tolerant towards children but can be rather dominant towards their own kind.  Provided they are properly socialized with young, they can learn to get along with other household pets.  Friends of the family will be accepted, especially if the handler indicates approval, but unwanted visitors will be stopped. 

				EXERCISE:  This Bullmastiff has an average demand for exercise.  A couple of outings every day with several opportunities to run and play (on a leash) give it sufficient freedom of movement.

			"Bully Kutta": {
			},

			"Cairn Terrier": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Scotland.

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Vermin destroyer, hunting dog, and family pet.  

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 28 - 31cm (11 - 12 1/4 in) tall, but this must be in proportion to the weight, which can vary from 6 - 7.5kg (13 1/4 - 16 1/2lb).  

				COAT:  The Cairn Terrier - like the West Highland Terrier - has a double-layered coat of which the topcoat is hard and abundant and the undercoat is soft and short.  The hair must not curl.  Permitted colors are grey, wheat, cream-red, or almost black.  Darker markings on the ears and muzzle are highly  regarded.  Cairns may not be white or totally black. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The Cairn's coat needs regular grooming with a brush and comb.  About twice a year - depending upon the condition of the hair - the dead hairs need to be plucked out by hand.  This can be done by a dog grooming shop but it is good to learn how to do it yourself.  From time to time remove excess hair from the ear  passages. A Cairn Terrier should have a somewhat rough appearance and is therefore not excessively groomed for showing.  For showing, any excessive hair around the feet, ears, and tail is removed. 

				CHARACTER:  This is an intelligent, brave, cheerful, lively, playful and extroverted dog which is hard upon itself, uncomplicated, affectionate, eager to learn, alert and vigilant. 

				TRAINING:  Teach this dog early to get on with cats and other household pets so that it will not chase them when it is older.  Puppies can take a game of pulling on a rope quite seriously.  You must decide when the game is to end by giving it the command "drop it".  The antics of puppies are often both cute and funny and remember that the tricks the dog might pull as a puppy will be less amusing when it is grown up.  The Cairn needs loving but also strict and consistent training. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  The Cairn Terrier makes a first-class friend for children; it can tolerate rough play and has a well-developed sense of humor.  These dogs can also get reasonably well with other dogs, although some dogs of this breed will fight for their rights as they see them.  They go into action when they detect danger.  

				EXERCISE:  This breed is bursting with energy and must get ample opportunity to run and play.  It is an ideal dog for a sporty family. It likes to be taken for a walk in the woods or in open countryside where it can run free, but make sure before you do so that the dog will return to you when you call - the hunting instinct is so strong in these dogs that they can run away if you aren't careful.

				 SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  These dogs mix well with other dogs, and live happily alongside other pets, provided they have been correctly socialized.  They are usually patient with children but the dogs in particular can be possessive of their territory.  This breed tends to be reserved with strangers and makes a good watchdog.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Former Soviet Union. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  The shoulder-height is a minimum of 65cm (25 ½ in) for dogs and 62cm (24 ½ in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  The Caucasian Owtcharka has three different kinds of coat; long-haired with a collar and longer-haired hindquarters; short-haired; and medium-length hair without the collar and the long hairs on the hindquarters.  The main colors are different shades of grey with light to rust markings; yellow, white, dun, and rust-brown; they can be multi-colored and patterned. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The long-haired kinds require grooming from time to time with brush and comb, especially where tangles might occur.  The coat of the short-haired variety needs less grooming.

				CHARACTER:  The Caucasian Owtcharka’s original role was to protect livestock from four-legged and two-legged predators.  It is a very brave, vigilant, and strong, hardy dog.  It distrusts people it does not know as it has a powerful urge to defend. 

				TRAINING:  If you are thinking of owning a Caucasian Owtcharka, you should be strong in character and physique.  This dog has a strong sense of right and wrong and you must never treat it severely or punish it unfairly. The right handler can develop a Caucasian Owtcharka which is obedient and very loyal through mutual respect.  Such a dog will protect the family and home with its life. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Everything and everyone who belongs to the family – and that includes children, cats, chickens, or whatever – will be regarded by this dog as part of its family and respected and protected.  Do not leave it alone with your children because if play should become rough when they play with other children, the Caucasian Owtcharka will defend your children, perhaps excessively.  It has no time for strangers but will greet family friends warmly.  It can be rather dominant towards other dogs. 

				EXERCISE:  This breed of dog is best suited to a family with lots of space surrounding the home where it can attend to its own exercise.  Because its thick coat protects it so well, it can happily cope with living outside.

			"Cesky Fousek": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Czech Republic and Slovakia.

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Field sports dog and family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 60-66cm (23 1/2 - 26in) for dogs and 58-62cm (22 3/4-24 1/2in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  The coat is rough and the most usual color is a brown (with or without patches), but plain brown with a white chest is also possible. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The condition of the coat determines how often the Cesky Fousek needs to have its hair hand-plucked: never, once a year, or more often.  The beard, moustache, and eyebrows are left alone during this process. Between plucking sessions, brush the coat occasionally and clip any excess hair between the pads of the feet.  Check for any hair growth in the ear passages and remove it.

				CHARACTER:  This is a friendly, intelligent, and gentle-natured dog which is affectionate, tractable, obedient, and vigilant.  Indoors they are calm; outdoors they are very active and tough on themselves. The Cesky Fousek is an all-round field sports dog but is a specialist pointer (they stand unmoving facing their prey as the wind carries the scent of wild game to them). 

				TRAINING:  Because they are quick and eager pupils, the training of this breed is not particularly difficult.  Make sure, though, that there is plenty of variety because when they are made to do the same thing over and over they will protest.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: Cesky Fousek get on fine with other dogs and other household animals, although their  hunting instints can cause problems with cats, for example.  They are fine with children provided they are not pestered by them. 

				EXERCISE:  These through-and-through hunting dogs need lots of exercise to get rid of their energy.  If you are unable to hunt with the dog or do not wish to do so, then it is essential to let them trot alongside a bicycle regularly and to let them run and play off the leash.  This will keep the dog mentally as well as physically fit.

				CARE REQUIRED:  The Cesky should be trimmed regularly, leaving the hair long on the stomach and legs and around the face(moustache, beard, and eyebrows). If the dog is a pet, it will need to be trimmed about four times a year; dogs for showing require more frequent grooming.  The longer hair needs to be brushed or combed twice a week or more, depending upon the condition of the coat to prevent tangles.  Clip the excess hair between the pads of the feet and remove loose hairs in the ear passages. 

				CHARACTER:  The Cesky is a good-humored dog which is affectionate, very adaptable, stalwart and hardy, sporty but calm.  It is intelligent and sociable. 

				TRAINING:  The training of this breed is not very demanding.  It is important to let the puppy meet with various people and different animals in positive circumstances and to experience a variety of situations to enable it to grow up to be a happy adult.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  This sociable dog gets on well with its own kind and with other household animals.  It is always loving with children but can be somewhat cautious with strangers. 

				EXERCISE:  The Cesky Terrier has an average demand for exercise.  This dog likes to frolic and play but it also enjoys walks through a  wood or across open countryside. 

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  Cesky Terriers are always born black.  The coat lightens later - in some cases not until the dog is over two years old.

			"Chesapeake Bay Retriever": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  United States. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Field sports dog and family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 58-66cm(22 3/4 -26in) for dogs and 53-61cm (20 3/4 - 24in) for bitches.  Greater consideration is given in the show ring to correct proportion than to height. 

				COAT:  The Chesapeake's coat is its trade mark, thick and short with a dense woolly undercoat.  The coat may be wavy in some places but never curly and it feels greasy to the touch.  The color is between yellow-brown, and dark brown.  The darker coloring is more usual. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  Grooming of this breed is fairly simple.  Brush the dog to remove dead and loose hairs when it is shedding but take care not to harm the texture of the coat.  In order to keep the texture of the coat, avoid washing this dog. 

				CHARACTER:  These are friendly, intelligent, and obedient dogs with a mind of their own.  These dogs love swimming, tend to be a little boisterous, and are demanding of themselves.  The males may try to dominate other dogs.  

				TRAINING:  This breed is not recommended for the inexperienced new dog owner.  The handler needs to be consistent and to exude authority because these dogs like to have their own way.  They are less gentle than many breeds, for example the Golden Retriever.  A consistent but kind approach is the most successful way to handle these dogs.  Attend an obedience class with this dog.  They are usually slow to mature. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  This dog will get along perfectly well with a cat that is already present in the house, but may chase other cats.  The dogs in particular can behave dominantly toward other males, although this may depend upon their social training.  Take the young dog out with you as often as possible and introduce it to other dogs so that it has the chance to feel relaxed with them.  Chesapeake Bay Retrievers get on extremely well with children but are somewhat reserved toward strangers. 

				EXERCISE:  This breed needs lots of exercise.  If they do not get it, they may become badly behaved from simple boredom.  Swimming and retrieving are two activities which they greatly enjoy.  They also like field sports.  They are, however, somewhat slow learners.

			"Chihuahua": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Mexico. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Family pet. 

				SIZE:  The Chihuahua is the world's smallest dog, weighing between 500-2,500g (1-5 1/2lb). 

				COAT:  There are long-coat and short-coat Chihuahuas.  Their colors include black, white, blue, red, or wheaten, with or without dark or white markings. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The long-haired type of Chihuahua should be groomed normally with brush and comb while the short-haired ones should be groomed occasionally with a rubber brush.  Administer eye- drops regularly to prevent "tear" stains, and check the teeth frequently for tartar and to ensure with young dogs that the new teeth are forming properly.  Keep the claws trimmed. 

				CHARACTER:  These are intelligent, brave little dogs, but sometimes they are too brave for their own good.  They can be stubborn, and can also be sensitive, and playful.  Chihuahuas usually bond with one person. 

				TRAINING:  Because these little dogs can do little damage, they are usually not trained.  This is a shame because the Chihuahua is an eager pupil. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Chihuahuas are sociable animals so that living together with dogs and cats does not usually cause any difficulty.  Do not forget that they are so small that they can easily be trampled underfoot by larger dogs.  They are not suitable for small children who will tend to regard the dog as a toy.

				EXERCISE:  Because these dogs are so small, they usually get sufficient exercise indoors.  If taught to do so, they can use a cat litter tray for their toilet.  They feel the cold, damp, and draughts, and they need to wear a coat when they go outside in cold or rainy weather.

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  The Chihuahua is a perfect choice for people who do not have much space in their home.  You can easily take them with you everywhere and they are inexpensive to feed.  It is a shame that this little creature is regarded as a toy.  Try not to forget that this animal is a read dog, in spite of its size, complete with the needs of all dogs.

			"Chinese Chongqing Dog": {

			"Chinese Crested": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  China. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Companionship dog. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 28-33cm (11 - 13in) for dogs and 23-30cm (9-11 3/4in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  There are two sorts of Chinese Crested.  One only has hair on its head, ears the tip of the tail, and a few on the feet.  The hairless body feels soft to the touch.  The other type is known as the Powder Puff.  This type has an undercoat and a veil-like topcoat of silken hair.  Any color is acceptable.  These two varieties are interbred with each other. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The skin of the Chinese Crested requires careful attention.  Those with show dogs wash the skin regularly with skin exfoliating creams made for humans to remove the dead cells and to soften the skin.  The important point is for the skin to be supple and smooth and protected against becoming dry.  There are excellent lotions and creams for this purpose.  The unpigmented areas of the dog's skin are especially sensitive to the sun and it is advisable to either keep the dog out of the sun entirely or to use a good quality sunscreen on it. The Powder Puff should be brushed now and then and washed frequently.  Usually these dogs have the hair on the face clipped to form downward- facing points to achieve the typical style of this type of dog. 

				CHARACTER:  These are high-spirited, cunning, and playful dogs that are sensitive, vigilant, very lively, and active.  They are cautious with people they do not know.

				TRAINING:  The Chinese Crested is not difficult to train because this dog is intelligent and quick to grasp what is required of it. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Provided children do not disturb the dog in what it considers its own territory, they will have no problems with this dog.  These dogs also rarely cause problems with other dogs and pets. 

				EXERCISE:  They adapt to the family circumstances in terms of their exercise.  If you can give them lots of exercise they will enjoy that but if you can't they will be content with their three walks around the block.  

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  Skin wounds hardly show up on the dogs with hair but the opposite is the case with the  Chinese Crested.  An advantage of these dogs is that they are very clean and there are no loose hairs to litter the carpet.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Sicily. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hunting dog and family pet. 

				SIZE:  Dogs 46-50cm (18 - 19in), bitches 16 - 19in. 

				COAT:  This Sicilian dog has a short-haired coat.  All shades of red are permissible and one white marking is accepted, although this is fairly rare. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  This breed's coat does not require much attention.  The shine on the coat can be kept in good condition by occasionally running a rubber glove over it.  Check at frequent intervals that the ear passages are clean and keep the claws short. 

				CHARACTER:  This is a friendly, affectionate, active dog which is intelligent and very loyal to its handler and the family and is also vigilant. Most of these dogs like to bark and tend to demand plenty of attention. 

				TRAINING:  The Cirneco dell'Etna is a relatively easy dog to train but the handler needs to be very consistent. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  This breed tends to be rather reserved with other dogs but generally gets on well with its own breed.  There will be no problems with your own cat but it will chase any strange cats.  These dogs are loving and patient with children.  They will bark at strangers but that is all. 

				EXERCISE:   Because this breed needs lots of exercise it is necessary to set aside an hour every day for this purpose. Running alongside a bicycle or actual hunting if there is hunting in your area are ideal forms of exercise for them. 

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  The Cirneco dell'Etna is considered a bit of a Greyhound, because it hunts by sight and sound as well as by nose.  Don't let these dogs run free off the leash unless you are absolutely certain there is no wild game nearby or their hunting instincts will come into action and the dog will run away. These dogs can jump extremely high so your yard needs a good high fence.  They like to be near you and are definitely house dogs, unsuitable for kennel life.

			"Clumber Spaniel": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  England. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Field sports dog and family pet.

				WEIGHT:  The weight is about 36kg (79lb) for dogs and 30kg (66lb) for bitches. 

				COAT:  The Clumber Spaniel has a dense coat of medium-length silken hair.  The color is usually white with lemon markings, although orange markings are also permissible. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat must be groomed regularly with brush and comb and the ear passages should be kept clean.  Some of these dogs develop an irritation of the ear but there are special lotions which can provide relief for this.  Occasionally it will become necessary to trim them back to breed standard, removing the unruly hairs which stick out, leaving the dog looking fist class once more.  If there is too much hair under the ears, clip it before the next overall trim.

				CHARACTER:  This is a gentle, equable, cheerful, brave, noble dog with a good memory, and considerable stamina.  These dogs are calm indoors. 

				TRAINING:  Because this dog has a good memory and likes to do things to please its handler it is a fairly easily taught pupil.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Clumber Spaniels get on well with other dogs and that is true also for cats and other household animals.  They are usually very trustworthy with children but they do not make friends easily with strangers.  Don't expect these dogs to be friends with everybody.  

				EXERCISE:  The Clumber Spaniel is primarily a field sports dog but it has no difficulty adapting its exercise needs to the family.  If you dog does not get a good amount of exercise, watch its diet carefully as it gains weight easily.

			"Dachshund": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Germany. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Family pet but also a hunting dog for above and below ground.  These dogs are fanatical hunters of badgers, rabbits, deer, wild boar, and foxes. 

				SIZE:  Dachunds are divided into three size groups.  The largest are the Standard, with a chest girth upwards from 35cm (13 3/4in).  The Standard should have a maximum weight of 9kg (20 lb).  The Minature Dachshund has a chest girth of 30 - 35cm (11 3/4 - 13 3/4 in), and the smallest sort, the Kaninchen or "little rabbit" is recognized by a chest girth smaller than 30cm (11 3/4 in).  

				COAT:  The coat consists of short smooth-hairs and is most frequently reddish-brown or black and tan. Some dogs, however, are chocolate brown and there are dogs with almost tiger-like markings.  

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat of the Smooth-haired Dachshund needs little attention.  Remove dead and loose hairs with a rubber brush from time to time.  Keep the ear passages clean and the claws short.  Most Dachshunds are dainty feeders.  Be careful not to give them too much to eat because a fat Dachshund is an unhealthy one.  

				CHARACTER:  The Dachshund is brave, dominant, has a mind of its own, is cunning, vigilant, resourceful, lively,  tenacious, and curious.  It has a sense of humor.  The Smooth-haired almost literally attaches itself to its own people, except when the hunting instinct rears its head.  A Dachshund needs to be introduced when it is young to many different situations for it to develop properly as an adult.  

				TRAINING:  The Smooth-haired likes to dominate other dogs and has a mind of its own so it has to be consistently trained.  With the right approach and much patience it is possible to teach this dog quite a lot but it will never slavisly follow your commands.  Dachshunds can sulk terribly if they feel they have been unfairly punished and they are very determined when they want something.  Puppy training courses can be very good for young Dachshunds.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  The family comes first with Dachshunds and they have little time for strangers which they will show by a  rather reserved manner to people they don't know.  If they are introduced early to children so they they have positive experiences with them, the Smooth will not cause any problems.  They usually get on reasonably well with other dogs, although some of them can be over-courageous in their approach to larger dogs.  Because of their passion for hunting, these dogs are definitely not suitable playmates for other small household animals. Introduce to cats when young to prevent later problems when it's older.

			"Dalmatian": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Croatia. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Family pets.  Dalmatians used to be bred as carriage dogs as they were highly decorative when running ahead of a coach.  They also acted as watchdogs in the stables.  

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 56-61cm (22-24in) for dogs and 54-59cm (21 1/4 - 23 1/4in) for bitches.  

				COAT:  The coat is always short.  The most attractive coat does not have the sports overlapping each other.  The ideal size for the spots is a diameter of 2 - 3cm (3/4-1 1/4in).  There are white with black-spotted Dalmatians and those with liver-colored spots.  

				CARE REQUIRED: The Dalmatian sheds very little hair in your home.  Remove loose hairs daily by grooming with a rubber glove during when the dog is shedding.  

				CHARACTER:  This is a high-spirited dog with lots of stamina that is friendly, affectionate, intelligent, vigilant, curious, equable, and sociable.

				TRAINING:  This is not a difficult dog to train.  Praise excessively when it does something well and it will quickly understand your intentions.  These dogs can turn a deaf ear to commands they do no like. In such cases hold your ground and don't give in.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  These are excellent playmates for children, although they can be too boisterous for smaller children.  With other dogs and household pets, there is also generally no difficulty.  With  visitors, they either act very vigilantly or rather half-heartedly, depending on the character of the individual dog.  

				EXERCISE:  The Dalmatian will adapt to your family circumstances but you do an injustice if you limit this dog to three little outings per day.  Running alongside a bicycle, swimming, playing, and running free through woods and in open countryside will all be good for this dog.  Avoid over-exercising before the dog is fully grown.  

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  It is extremely difficult to breed good show dogs.  Dalmatians are born white and acquire their spots later.  Some puppies are born deaf and it is really advisable to get your puppy from a really reliable breeder

				TRAINING:  The Training of this dog is not difficulty, but allowance must be made for the fact that it can be stubborn.

			"Deerhound": {
				
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Great Britian. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hunter by sight of large game and family pet.  

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is a minimum of 76cm (30in) for dogs and 71cm (28in) for bitches.  

				COAT:  The rough, medium-length coat should not feel woolly.  The most common and the most prized color is dark blue grey.  Yellow, sandy red, light grey, and roans of these colors are also possible, with dark mask and ears.  A small amount of white on the tip of the tail, chest, and feet is acceptable.  

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat should be brushed thoroughly on a regular basis.  Pluck excess hair from the ear passages from time to time and remove surplus hair between the pads of the feet.  The coat may require plucking by hand once or twice per year depending on its condition.  

				CHARACTER:  These are friendly, gentle, sensible, and straightforward dogs that are noble, intelligent, kind to children, and not particularly vigilant.  They rarely bark but are rather hard on themselves physically.  Most of them have very strong hunting instincts.  

				TRAINING:  The Deerhound learns quite quickly providing the handler and dog understand each other.  A friendly request is often all that is needed to get the dog to do what you want.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  With dogs similar to the Deerhound can get along fine and there are few difficulties with children.  Some of the dogs of this breed have stronger hunting instincts than others and this will have to be remembered if you have cats and other animals.  

				EXERCISE:  This dog needs lots of exercise.  Once you have seen how much enjoyment they get when allowed to run freely you will understand that these dogs cannot be limited to three trips around the block a day.  Trotting alongside a bicycle will keep them both mentally and physically fit.

			"Deutsche Bracke": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Germany. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hunting and family pet.  

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 40-53cm (15 3/4 - 20 3/4in).  

				COAT:  The smooth-coat is hard to the touch.  The colors usually range from red to yellow with a black saddle, or a black mantle with a white blaze, collar, and chest and more white markings on  the feet and tip of the tail.  The undercoat is light-colored.  A flesh-colored patch on the nose is considered important.  

				CARE REQUIRED:  The Deutsche Bracke does not require much grooming.  Run a rubber brush over the coat occasionally to remove dead and loose hairs.  Check the ear passages regularly to ensure they are clean and remember that this breed is supposed to have fairly long claws.  

				CHARACTER:  This is a friendly, sociable, affectionate, sensitive, shy, yet curious dog which has great reserves of stamina.  It is reasonably obedient although independent-minded and vigilant.  These dogs have a good scenting nose and make excellent hunting dogs.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: These are sociable dogs which will rarely cause any problems in the company of other dogs.  They are also fine with children.  These dogs always will warn you of any strangers.  Introduce them when  young to cats and other household animals.  They hold their ground with strangers.   

				EXERCISE:  The breed is ideally suited for hunting hares, rabbits, and foxes.  Most of them like to swim.  If you do not intend to hunt with them, make sure you find some other means of fulfilling their exercise needs.  In common with other hounds, they are likely to forget everything they learned in their training lessons in the interest of chasing and exciting scent, so do not let them run around off the leash.

			"Doberman":{
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Germany

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Guard and defense dog, and family pet.

				SIZE:  This shoulder size is (26 ¼ - 31 in) for dogs and 63 – 68cm (25-29 in) for bitches.  The weight is between 32 – 45kg (85 – 130lb) for dogs. 

				COAT:  The color of the sleek smooth coat of short hairs is often black and tan, or brown and tan.  Coats of blue and tan, or grey-yellow and tan are not recognized in every country. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  A Doberman’s coat does not require much attention.  During shedding use a rubber glove with knobbled surface to remove dead and loose hairs. Keep the claws short and check the teeth from time to time for tartar. 

				CHARACTER:  The Doberman is an active, cunning dog which bonds closely and is brave, intelligent, a good guard dog, loyal, dependent, occasionally nosy and boisterous.  It has tremendous stamina.  Doberman’s have a tendency to become extremely loyal to one particular person. 

				TRAINING:  This strong handsome dog requires very careful and consistent training.  Strive to ensure everything is harmonious throughout the training.  If you have little experience of training dogs, then you are seriously advised not to acquire one of this breed.   If Doberman’s are wrongly brought up they can become quite neurotic making them fearful and/or snappy – while their natural character is straightforward and reliable.  Always act clearly and fairly with a Doberman.  Never hit it and make absolutely sure it is not pestered.  Doberman’s are ideally suited to defense-dog training, but do not start too young and avoid too much pressure on the dog in the early stages – never force it!  Wait for really serious activity until a Doberman has matured somewhat.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  A properly socialized Doberman can get along fine with other dogs, other household pets, and children.  Unwanted visitors are stopped in their tracks.

				EXERCISE:  A Doberman cannot be fobbed off with a daily trot around the neighborhood. It is built for speed and has tremendous stamina.  Take it swimming, or let it run alongside your bicycle, or run free in the woods.  This breed is ideal for a variety of sporting activities.

			"Doberman Pinscher": {

			"Dogo Argentino": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Argentina.

				OTHER NAMES: Argentinian Mastiff, Dogo Argentino, Argentine Dogo

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Hunting dog.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is 60 –65cm (23 ½ - 25 ½ in).

				COAT: The Argentinian Mastiff has a short coat which is always white, sometime with pigment flecks in the skin. A small black patch between the ears is permissible. There is also an extremely rare version with a long-haired coat.

				CARE REQUIRED: The coat of the Argentinian Mastiff is very easy to keep in condition. Remove dead and loose hairs during shedding with a rubber brush. Keep the claws short and, as is necessary with all dogs, make sure the ear passages are kept clean.

				CHARACTER: This brave, even-tempered dog is loyal to its handler and family, barks little, is demanding of itself, has considerable stamina, and a strongly developed hunting instinct. The dogs in particular may tend to try to dominate other dogs.

				TRAINING: This dog is definitely not a breed for beginners. It requires a well-balanced, loving, but very consistent upbringing. Try to reward it when things go well and when they go wrong punish the dog solely with your voice. A combination of isolation in a kennel with a tough training regime is cruel and can lead to unpredictable behavior from this dog.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: These dogs usually get on well with children although some of them can be rather boisterous. It is possible to socialize them to tolerate cats and other pets but it is not advisable to expect and Argentinian Mastiff to share a house with them. Remember that this is a hunting dog which will regard a cat or sheep as prey. They are not an ideal choice as watchdogs because of their hunting instincts although they are certainly likely to frighten away most wrongdoers.

				EXERCISE: For this dog to be happy it should be taken regularly for long walks. A walk around the block three times a day is definitely not enough. In a large enough fenced yard it will burn-off its energy itself. Because of its strong hunting instincts and dominant behavior towards other dogs, an Argentinian Mastiff must be firmly controlled when walked on a leash.

				SPECIAL REMARKS: This breed is banned in some countries. They are not suitable for beginners. Many of these dogs are deaf. Purchase puppies only for a trust worthy recognized breeder.

			"Dogue de Bordeaux": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  France. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Watchdog and family dog. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 60 – 70cm (23 ½ - 27 ½ in) for dogs and their minimum weight is 50kg (110 lb).  The shoulder-height is 58 – 66cm (22 ¾ - 26in) for bitches and their minimum weight is 45kg (99 lb). 

				COAT:  The coat consists of soft short hair of mahogany red or brown, with a red or black face.  White markings are considered unacceptable. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  Brush the coat regularly when the dog is shedding with a rubber brush to remove dead and loose hairs.  If necessary, clean the folds in the face.  In common with other large dogs, the Dogue de Bordeauz grows quickly and needs all its energy to build a healthy body.  Do not allow a young dog to tire itself and ensure it gets ample food of sufficient nourishment. 

				CHARACTER:  This is an equable, calm dog which rarely barks and is friendly, attentive, curious, very brave, and physically demanding of itself.  It bonds closely with its handler and family.  The Bordeaux will protect the family and guard the house and grounds. 

				TRAINING:  Give the Bordeaux a consistent training in a fair and calm manner.  This dog becomes very attached to and wants to please its handler.  Make a fuss of the dog and let it see you are pleased when it behaves well, and speak encouragingly to it. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  When the Bordeaux has had lots of positive experiences in its youth, enabling it to develop as a happy dog, its behavior with other pets will probably be fine.  These dogs are usually kind and protective with children.  Visitors are initially eyed mistrustfully but once the dog’s handler says the visitors are “all right”, they are accepted by the dog.  This breed can be rather dominant towards other dogs. 

				EXERCISE:  This breed has average exercise demands.  Two walks (on the leash) each day together with running and playing off the leash a few times each week are sufficient for it. 

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  This strong dog bonds figuratively and almost literally to the family.  It will consider separation as a punishment.  Do not choose this breed if you have to be away from the house for long periods.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  The Netherlands. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Sheepdog and family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 57 – 62cm (22 ½ in – 24 ½ in) for dogs and 55 – 60cm (21 ¾ - 23 ½ in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  There are three different types of coat for the Dutch Shepherd: short-haired (silver and gold streaks), rough-haired (blue-grey pepper-and-salt-colored, or silver and gold streaked).  With all varieties, dogs for the show ring should not display too much white on their chest and feet. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  Both short and long-haired coats require regular grooming with brush and comb to remove dead and loose hairs.  The rough-haired coat should never be brushed, although combing is fine in moderation.  Always use a coarse comb.  Have the coat plucked by a professional twice a year.  The hair can be clipped in a few places as a finishing touch and the excessive hair in the ears should be removed. 

				CHARACTER:  This affectionate dog is eager to learn, intelligent and obedient, sober, very loyal to its handler and family, incorruptible, active, lively, and alert. 

				TRAINING:  Dutch Shepherds are happy to be all-round dogs.  They can and will learn new commands quickly.  In certain branches of sport such as agility, catch, and obedience competitions, they can eclipse their rivals.  The short-haired type is the most usual sort for defense/police dogs trials. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Dutch Shepherds enjoy the company of their own kind and get along fine with other animals.  Provided children let the dogs have some peace when they want it, the dogs can also be good friends for children. Unwanted visitors are stopped in their tracks, while known family friends will be greeted enthusiastically. 

				EXERCISE:  It is good for this breed to let it regularly run beside a bicycle, or take it into the woods or open countryside where it can run to its heart’s content.  Because Dutch Shepherds want to work, run them through a regular drill at least twice per week to keep them both physically and mentally fit.

			"Elkhound": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Sweden. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hunting dog for large game. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 60 - 65cm (23 1/2 - 25 1/2 in) for dogs and 55- 60cm (21 1/2 - 23 1/2in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  The Elkhound has a cream thick undercoat with thick, densely packed covering hair.  The color of the outer-coat is dark or light grey and there should be cream patches on the nose, cheeks, throat, stomach, front of the chest, legs, and underside of the tail.  

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat hardly needs any grooming.  During shedding it is best to use a comb with a double row of metal teeth to remove loose hairs from the under-layer of the coat.  In common with other Artic dogs, the hair of the Elkhound does not have the typical dog smell. 

				CHARACTER:  This breed is equable, straightforward, intelligent and cunning, has a sense of humor, is sensitive to nuances in the voice, and is physically demanding of itself.  

				TRAINING:  This dog needs a calm handler who exudes a natural authority.  A calm and consistent manner of approach to its training is essential.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  The Elkhound gets on with other dogs even though its bark can have a frightening effect upon them. They are rather reserved with strangers but they don't make good watchdogs.  These dogs get on well with children and also with any other animals in or around the home. 

				EXERCISE:  The Elkhound is a hunting dog through and through and is still used for this purpose in its native country. Its task is to track large wild animals independently and bring them down and it will search large areas to do this.  This dog is not suitable for life in an urban environment.  If it is allowed off the leash, the chance is its hunting instincts may well cause it to run away.  In wild countryside, the Elkound will normally be constantly on the move.  It verges on cruelty to animals to enclose such a dog and limit it to three short walks each day.

			"English Bulldog": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  England. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Family pet. 

				SIZE:  The English Bulldog weighs 22 – 25kg (48 ½ - 55 lb) and stands 31 – 36cm (12 – 14 in). 

				COAT:  The coat is short and is found in beige, red-brown, brindle (with or without a black face), white (with lots of dark pigment on the muzzle and eye) and piebald.  Black liver, and black tan are not acceptable colors. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  When the Bulldog sheds, it is easy to remove dead and loose hairs with a rubber brush.  When necessary clean the folds in the face with a special lotion made for this purpose.  The English Bulldog prefers to lie in a draught-free soft, dry place, and a kennel can be suitable if it meets those requirements. 

				CHARACTER:  The Bulldog is animated, spontaneous, uncomplicated, and equable with a sense of humor, gentle-natured, sensitive but demanding of itself.  This dog can be fearless if necessary, intelligent in a thoughtful way, and peaceful in the house.  These dogs are very affectionate and prefer to be close to the family. 

				TRAINING:  Bulldogs are usually easy to train.  They are very sensitive to your voice or voices and will often respond to a friendly but determined request.  Consistency is most important in training these dogs and be sure they understand what you want. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Mixing with other dogs and household pets is usually problem-free.  They make ideal friends for children and are very tolerant.  Most also have a well-developed sense of humor.  Some English Bulldogs are extremely wary of strangers, while others are friends with everybody. 

				EXERCISE:  This is not a breed requiring long walks.  The English Bulldog will be quite happy with those short outings a day and for the rest of the time they will be pleased to stay in the house or yard, provided the family is close by, which makes them ideal for less active people.  Bulldog puppies have a tendency to keep on running and playing when they are exhausted.  Make sure they get sufficient rest and limit their exercise so that their energy can be used to build healthy bones, joints and muscles.  They are not able to withstand heat, so make sure they have somewhere cool to lie in on hot days.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Originally, this breed was developed to herd reindeer. Current day, these dogs participate in K-9 utility work, sport tracking, obedience and agility trials, and as devoted and loving pets.

				GROUP: U.K.C. Classification: Herding Group HEIGHT AT WITHERS: Males: 19 – 21 inches Females: 17 – 19 inches

				WEIGHT: Note: These sizes are average; your dog can be smaller or bigger than average size.

				COAT and COLORS: Finnish Reindeer Herders have a double coat that enables it to withstand the arctic climate. The outer coat is fairly long, straight, harsh and erect; the undercoat is fine and dense. The coat is denser on the neck, chest and back of thighs. Colors: Black, gray or dark brown, with lighter shadings. White markings on the neck, chest and legs are permitted. The undercoat is black, grayish or brownish.

				BUILD: A medium-sized, spitz-like breed, with a rectangular body (clearly longer than tall), with strong but not heavy bone and musculature. The sex of the dog should be readily apparent by visual examination.

				HEAD/NECK: The head shape is of the typical spitz type, with the muzzle shorter than the skull and a sloping stop. The skull is slightly convex, with a marked frontal furrow and the superciliary ridges clearly defined. The muzzle tapers evenly from the eyes to the nose. The nasal bridge is straight and the lips are tight. The teeth should meet in a scissors bite. The nose should be preferably black but may harmonize with the color of the coat in dogs that are other than black. The eyes are set rather well apart, oval in shape and dark in color, harmonizing with coat color. Expression is keen and lively, and in females, devoted. The ears are set well apart, broad at the base, tapering to the tips and carried erect. The inside of the ears is furnished with thick hair. The neck should be strong, medium length, blending smoothly into the shoulders.

				BODY/TAIL/LEGS: The body should be longer than tall by 10 percent. The withers are marked, and the chest is deep and spacious, but not broad. The ribs are well sprung.

The tail is of medium in length, set low, and profusely coated. In repose, the tail hangs down. In movement, it is carried in a loose curl, but may not be raised over the back. The tail action may be circular. The forelegs should be muscular and well angulated. When viewed from the front, the front legs should be straight and parallel. The elbows are close to the body, and the carpus is sinewy and flexible. The pasterns are slightly oblique, allowing for flexible movement. Leg length from elbow to ground is half the height at the withers. The hindlegs should be well angulated, with rather long and broad thighs and strong muscles. When viewed from behind, the back legs should be straight and parallel, with marked angulation at the stifle and the hock, which is well let down. Rear pasterns are short and vertical. The feet should be oval, with well-arched toes and thick pads, and a heavy covering of hair, including on the bottom.

				GAIT: The gait should be free, flexible and effortless, giving the appearance of being tireless. At faster speed there is a tendency to single track. * Note: The size and aesthetic characteristics indicated are the general goals of most breeders and may vary among the breed.

				CHARACTER: Docile and calm in the home, friendly and energetic and willing to work outside; a characteristic of the breed is their tendency to bark freely when working. These dogs make excellent companions as long as they have a life with a purpose; they need to be challenged physically and mentally everyday. They are protective by nature and will naturally monitor the house with vigilance; while not aggressive, they are reserved with strangers. They live to please their masters and are easy and a delight to train; they do best when they can work with, not for their pack leader. This breed does best with experienced dog owners who know how to be consistent and continual pack leaders; in such hands, these dogs require only a gentle training approach as they are very in tune with their owners and handlers. These dogs are extremely sensitive and will do poorly in harsh hands or in a house that is not at peace. These dogs get along well with other dogs though they do not do well in packs.

				CARE REQUIRED: Their coats are low maintenance, are easy to keep clean and are rain resistant. A weekly brushing is all that is required.

				EXERCISE REQUIRED: As with most herding breeds, this breed needs daily mental and physical exercise.

				HEALTH ISSUES: These dogs are known for their hardiness and are relatively long lived – typically into their mid teens.

If it has the exercise, it will be content to spend the evening at its handler's feet.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  France. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is about 30cm (11 3/4in) and the weight is 8-13kg (17 1/2-28 1/2lb). 

				COAT:  The coat is made up of short, shiny hairs which lie one upon another to form a dense layer.  They can be a roan but fawn and white with streaked patches is the most usual combination.  

				CARE REQUIRED:  There is little to the grooming of this breed.  Brush them occasionally with a rubber brush and keep the ear passages clean - do not use cotton swabs as they tend to push the wax and debris into the ear.  Clip the claws to keep them short and treat the facial creases with a special lotion occasionally.  Petroleum Jelly can also be used.  

				CHARACTER:  These are intelligent, very affectionate, lovable dogs that are tolerant of children, and also playful, cheerful, sensitive, sometimes boisterous, with a strongly developed sense of humor. They are persistent, tough on themselves, and sometimes can be obstinate.  French Bulldogs can be jealous if their owner's attention is directed elsewhere.  They like to be part of the family and hate being left alone.  

				TRAINING:  This breed is not difficult to train because they are bright and learn quickly.  Always be consistent with them.  They are not sensitive to the intonation of your voice but will pick up on any bad atmosphere in your home.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  It is often said that these dogs adore children but actually it is more the case that children adore these dogs.  Some of these dogs can try to dominate other dogs, although there are never problems with other household pets provided these dogs have met them when they were young and grown up with them.  Most of them are fond of people and visitors are generally enthusiastically welcomed, although some of the dogs can be quite antagonistic toward strangers.  

				EXERCISE:  Provided these dogs get enough attention they don't require much exercise.  In hot weather avoid exercise because of their short noses.  They usually are content with three walks around the block if they also have a chance to run and play in the yard.  They are ideal dogs for apartment living.  

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  The French Bulldog likes to be part of the family and can be taken everywhere with you. They do not belong in a kennel.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Spain. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hunting of small game by sight and family pet

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 65-70cm (25 1/2-27 1/2in) for dogs and 60-68cm (23 1/2-26 3/4in) for bitches.  

				COAT:  This breed has both a short and rough-haired version.  The majority of dogs are black, sandy, white, red, brown, yellow, or a roan.  

				CARE REQUIRED: Little grooming is required.  In common with other dogs, the ears should be checked regularly and the claws kept short.  

				CHARACTER:  These are intelligent, curious, and affectionate dogs which are kind to children and very loyal to their handler and family.  If necessary they will protect their family.  

				TRAINING:  With a very consistent approach and much patience and insight, these relatively untamed dogs can be basically trained in the basics.  Direct the dog's natural character in the desired direction but do not try to create a perfectly responsive machine because this is the wrong dog for that.  It is extremely important that the young dog becomes acquainted with a variety of people and situations.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  These dogs will rarely cause any problems with children because they are still close to nature and instinctively know that small persons need care. They like to play with other dogs and enjoy showing off their speed.  They are not, however, a good ideal choice of dog if you have cats or other small animals because they have strong hunting instincts which make them chase anything which suddenly moves and they cannot resist that instinct. 

				EXERCISE:  If these dogs have the freedom of a fair-sized piece of ground which is well fenced in, an outing twice a week with the bicycle for a chance of background will be sufficient.  If not, they will need a considerable amount of more formal exercise.  If this is not available the dog is likely to become very frustrated and to make this obvious.

On the head, inside of ears, on the front of the legs, and on the feet/toes, it should be short; it should be slightly longer on the neck and the rear of the thighs. Although the black and tan saddle may be most recognizable, German Shepherds come in a variety of colors and patterns though not all are desired. Two toned German Shepherds can be black and tan, black and red, black and brown, black and silver, black and cream, blue and tan, or liver and tan; always with the dark color forming a mask and a mantle. Solid colors may be black, white or any of the dilution genes (liver, blue, or cream). Dogs with coats that have tricolored hair (black and white with either brown or red) are called sable or agouti. Sables can come in a variety of mixtures as well, including black and silver, black and red, black and cream, and black and tan. Some various markings are referred to as 'striping' (black stripe markings on the legs found in some sables), "pencilling" (also often found on the sable as black lines on the top of the dog's toes), and “tar heels" (black that runs down the back of the dog's legs). A small, distinct white spot on the chest is acceptable. A light gray undercoat may be present.

				BUILD: The German Shepherd Dog is of medium size, slightly elongated, strong and well muscled, with dry bone and of firm overall structure. The length of the body is approximately 10-17 % longer than the height at the withers.

Chest is well down and should descend below the elbow. Strongly developed back. Broad, strong loin. Long, slightly oblique croup. Back sloping gently from the withers and should merge with the tail. The tail should reach at least to the hock joint but not beyond the middle of the metatarsus; the hair is slightly longer on the underside; it is carried hanging in a gentle curve, though when excited, may be held higher but never above the horizontal. The front legs should be straight and parallel when seen from all sides. The shoulder blade and upper leg should be equal in length and at a 90 to 110’ angle to one another. The elbows lay flat against the body. The pastern should be 1/3 the length of the foreleg; the angle between the two should be 20 and 22’. The hindlegs are placed slightly behind the rear; seen from the rear, they are parallel to each other. Upper and lower thigh are approximately of equal length and form an angle of about 120°. The thighs are strong and well muscled. The hock joints are strong and firm. The metatarsus stands vertically under the hock joint.

				CHARACTER: The German Shepherd is confident, alert, approachable, courageous, fearless, and unfailingly loyal dog, and has an excellent sense of smell. They are lively, eager, and highly trainable because of their intense desire to please their owners. In addition, the German Shepherd has an innate drive to protect the weakest members of their pack, be they the children or the most elderly persons in your home.

				CARE REQUIRED: Early training is vital. This breed does not like to be alone and cannot tolerate being closed inside all day. Brushing twice per week is required.

				EXERCISE REQUIRED: This is an active dog with a need for space and exercise, but can live in an apartment in the city if walked daily.

				HEALTH ISSUES: As is common of many large breeds, German Shepherds are susceptible to elbow and hip dysplasia. Other health problems sometimes occurring in the breed are von Willebrand's disease, skin allergies and canine degenerative myelopathy. It is also prudent to check the eye and ear health as GSD tend to have problems with these as well. German Shepherds, like all large bodied dogs, are also prone to bloat.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Germany.

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Watchdog, guard-dog, and family pet.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 60 –70cm (23 ½ 27 ½ in).

				COAT:  The coat is rough.  The most usual color is salt-and-pepper; a dark face is desirable with any color.

				CARE REQUIRED:  About twice a year the hair needs to be plucked.  Check regularly that there is not too much hair in the ears and snip it if necessary.  Excessive hair growth between the feet pads must also be dealt with.  To prevent tangles, comb the long decorative hair embellishments (beard, moustache, and eyebrows) that are a feature of its head.

				CHARACTER:  This is an alert, vigilant, hardy, and sober dog that does not wander, is very loyal to its handler and family, intelligent and eager to learn, thoughtful, and good-natured.  It has considerable stamina, and is not led astray by bribes.  Giant Schnauzers bond closely with the family of which they form part.

				TRAINING:  The breed, which is full of character, requires a sound upbringing.  If the training is consistent, fair and full of variety, it will enjoy it.  Provided you bear in mind that a Schnauzer has its own ideas and will not follow every command slavishly, it can do well in various sporting activities – especially defense dog trials.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  The Giant Schnauzer causes few problems with dogs and other pets. As with other dogs, he must be correctly socialized when young.  These dogs are naturally loving with children.  They are not interested in strangers and tend towards shyness, although to what extent depends largely upon their upbringing and socializing process.

				EXERCISE:  This is a breed that requires quite a lot of exercise.  Make sure that it gets plenty of outdoor exercise.

			"Glen of Imaal Terrier": {

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  This Terrier was once used for such things as hunting badgers and destroying vermin.  Today it is mainly a family pet.  

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height may be no greater than 35.5cm (14in).  In spite of its short height this is a robust dog.  

				COAT:  The Glen of Imaal Terrier has a medium-length hard and coarse outer coat, and a soft dense underlayer.  The colors range from dark grey (considered blue) with highlights, through to brindle, to wheaten.  

				CARE REQUIRED:  If your Glen of Imaal Terrier is a pet, hand plucking its coat about twice a year will be sufficient grooming; the coats of show dogs require more attention.  Clip excess hair between the pads of its feet and also remove it from the ear passages.  

				CHARACTER:  These dogs are calm, affectionate, brave, and very demanding of themselves.  They are loyal and intelligent but are late developers. They can be stubborn, are playful, lively, and boisterous.  They are usually calm indoors and they rarely bark without reason.  

				TRAINING:  The training of this breed need not be difficult.  They are keen to learn, but they can try to dominate and be stubborn.  The handler should be consistent at all times and have some play in every training routine.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Glen of Imaal Terriers get on well with children.  Some of the dogs of this breed can try to dominate other dogs, but provided they have had positive experiences with cats and other household animals when growing, they can happily mix with them.  Visitors that are known to the family will be cheerfully greeted, but unwelcome ones will be chased away.  These dogs will bark if they detect danger.  

				EXERCISE:  This breed will adapt its exercise needs to the family situation.

				CARE REQUIRED:  Groom regularly with brush and comb, trim excess hair between the pads of the feet, and check that the ears are clean at fixed intervals.  If necessary, the hair on the ears may be trimmed to create a well-groomed appearance. 

				CHARACTER:  This is a lovable, intelligent, sociable, self-confident, sensitive dog with a good memory. This dog adapts well to a variety of situations and is not given to barking very much. 

				TRAINING:  The Golden Retriever learns quickly and remembers what it has learned for the rest of its life.

			"Gordon Setter": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Scotland. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Field sports dog and family pet.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is about 66cm (26in) for dogs and about 62cm (24 1/2in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  The coat, which must never be curly, consists of medium-length hair with feathering.  The color is always black with warm chestnut markings.  A small white patch on the chest is permissible. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  Groom this dog regularly and check the ear passages to ensure they are clean.  The excess hair beneath the ear should be trimmed to let air reach the inner ear in order to avoid infections.  The hair on the outside of the ear should never be clipped - something that is permitted with other Setters.  If you wish to show your dog, grooming will require considerably more attention. 

				CHARACTER:  These are lovable, friendly, sociable, and intelligent dogs that are gentle and sensitive. These dogs do, however, often have minds of their own.

				 TRAINING:  The training of this dog is certainly not difficulty, provided you take account of the fact that it can be stubborn on occasion.  They call for a handler who is both consistent and loving in approach. It is a good idea to attend a puppy obedience training course with your dog. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  It is necessary to introduce the young dog to all manner of situations and experiences with people, animals, and things.  Only by doing so will you ensure the well-balanced development of this dog.  In general they get on well with other dogs and with children because they are a friend to everyone.  Good early social training will also ensure they can get along with cats and other household animals.  If strangers visit they adopt a wait-and-see attitude. 

				EXERCISE:  This breed needs plenty of exercise.  Running beside a bicycle is an ideal way to keep them fit but should not be started until the dog is fully grown.  A Gordon Setter that gets enough outdoor activity will be calm when indoors.  They are apt to roam, so a good fence around your property is essential.

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hound (pack hound for hunting wild game) and family pet.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height of the smaller or Petit Basset Griffon is 34-38cm (13 1/2 - 15in) and38-42cm (15-16 1/2in) for the larger or Grand Basset Griffon.

				COAT:  The rough-haired coat is hard, not very long, and has a somewhat unkempt look.  These dogs are either single-colored, two-colored, or tri-colored.   The single color is grey-white or tawny; the two-colored are white with either grey, red, orange, or black patches; and the combination of three colors are either white-black-red, or white or tawny grey with a greyish white and red.  Single-colored drab red is considered undesirable.

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat required regular grooming with brush and comb.  Keep the ears, and especially the ear passages, clean.  File claws that become too long and clip any hair that becomes too long between the pads of the feet to prevent tangles.  About once a year pluck the loose and dead hair out by hand. If you wish to show the dog, the neck should be emphasized by removing hair from this area.  The breed standard requires the Petit Basset Griffin to have small ears and a tail which is accentuated by clipping excessive hair.

				CHARACTER:  These are high-spirited, lively, sociable, clever, loving, and sensitive dogs.  They have minds of their own but are quite straightforward.

				TRAINING:  As these dogs are quite independent there is no point in hoping to turn on of them into a perfectly obedient dog.  With the right approach, however, and with patience it is possible to train these dogs to a certain extent.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Dogs, pets, children and visitors are all accepted without problem - this dog seems to liketo have lots of people and animals around.

				EXERCISE:  Because these hounds need substantial amounts of exercise, it is necessary to take them for long walks regularly. In France they hunt in packs.  The larger Grand Basset Griffon is used to hunt for hares and roe deer, while the smaller Petit is used for rabbit hunts.  They usually adapt well to becoming family pets.

			"Grand Gascon Saintongeois": {

			"Grand Griffon Vendeen": {
			},

			"Great Dane": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Germany.

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Previously hunting dog for large game, now watchdog, and family pet.

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is a minimum of 80cm (31 ½ in) for dogs and 72cm (28 ½ in) for bitches.  There is no maximum standard and generally people like the dogs to be well over the minimum height.  These dogs weigh 50kg (110 lb) and upwards, depending upon the size and sex.

				COAT:  These dogs have short smooth coats which have three accepted colors: yellow (which can be streaked) with a black face; black perhaps with a little white, or white with black spots (known as harlequin and the only variety permitted to have blue eyes and partially flesh colored muzzles); and blue.  Two other colors are accepted in some countries.  These are the Mantle which has a black coat covering almost all the dog with white showing on just the chest, neck, blaze, belly, legs and tip of the tail; and another variety where this mantle is broken with white.  Both are considered as black in some countries.  The different colors are not interbred.

				CARE REQUIRED:  The Great Dane’s coat requires very little attention.  During shedding it is best to remove dead and loose hairs with a rubber brush.  The Great Dane must always be allowed to lie somewhere soft to avoid pressure marks.  Fast growing breeds like the Great Dane require care during the growing stage.  The first essential is the right nutrition.  The other point to watch is to limit exercise, avoiding pressuring and overtiring the dog which can cause serious problems for the developing bones, joints and muscles.  These dogs do not belong in a kennel and like to be comfortable.

				CHARACTER:  These are affectionate, calm, and intelligent dogs that are sensible, sensitive, very loyal to the handler and family, not easily led astray by bribes, and are curious.  Despite that fact that they do not bark much, these dogs make excellent watchdogs.  It is said that a burglar may get into a house watched over by a Great Dane but can never get out.  Like other Mastiff types, the Great Dane is not very susceptible to pain and so it is possible that an illness or injury may be overlooked for some time.

				TRAINING:  The Great Dane grows in a very short period into a very large dog.  You must therefore teach it as a very young dog that it must not pull on the leash.  Train it with understanding and with great consistency. These dogs are very sensitive to the intonation of the voice and your friendly request will quite often be sufficient to get them to do what you require.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Generally Great Danes get on perfectly well with their own kind, other household pets, and children.  Most of them are rather unsure with strangers but friends of the family will be warmly greeted.

				EXERCISE:  These strong and elegant dogs require a great deal of exercise.  They will enjoy being able to run free and romping, of the leash, in open country o woodland.  They can also exercise running alongside a bicycle provided they stray strictly by you.  Great Danes that get sufficient outdoor exercise will be very peaceful indoors.

			"Greater Swiss Mountain Dog": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Switzerland. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Formerly a cattle driver, today a watchdog and family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 65 - 72cm (25 1/2 - 28 1/2 in) for dogs and 60 -68cm (23 1/2 - 27 in) for bitches.

				COAT:  The coat is straight-haired with a thick under coat.  The color is always black with rust and white markings. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog requires little grooming.  An occasional session with a rubber brush to remove dead and loose hairs is adequate.  

				CHARACTER:  This breed is intelligent, friendly, keen to work, watchful, reliable, and protective.  It is also equable, sociable, and obedient.  The dogs only bark when necessary. 

				TRAINING:  Even though this breed bonds closely with the family of which they form a part, they are not a suitable breed for everyone.  The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog has a very strong character and needs a handler who is equally strong.  It must get the chance to grow up in a well-balanced environment and have a clear understanding of what is permitted and what is not.  It needs to be able to build a close bond with its family.  Make sure that you are always consistent with it.  A severe approach will only ruin the dog's nature.  Watch and control it carefully during the growing stage so that all its energy can be used for building healthy bones and muscles.  For the same reason be generous with its food.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  This breed gets on well with other household animals. Under your care it will make a marvelous friend for your children too, but do not forget that it will protect your children against their friends it is thinks they are being pestered by them. They make excellent watchdogs which will protect you and your family together with all your possessions against wrongdoers.  They are not suited for living in a kennel.  

				EXERCISE:  This breed is a diligent worker which means, if you consider its intelligence, that it can make a multi-faceted and reliable= working dog for you.  In Switzerland it is used as a tracking dog.  This dog has the potential to shine at obedience training and in various other areas of the dog sporting activities.  When it happens that a week passes in which you are too busy to get out with your dog, it will accept it easily and not misbehave.  

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  This beautiful, imposing dog requires plenty of living space. It will not be happy in an apartment or small house without a yard.

			"Greyhound": {

                COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  England.

                SPECIAL SKILLS:  Racing dog, hunter by sight of large and small game, and family pet. 

                SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 71-76cm (28-30in) for dogs and 68-71cm (26 3/4-28in) for bitches. 

                COAT:  Greyhounds have a smooth, close coat of short hairs most commonly seen in black, white, fawn, orange, and roans of these colors or with other white markings.   

                CARE REQUIRED:  It is sufficient to groom the Greyhound occasionally with a soft brush.  However, the ears should be checked regularly and the claws kept trimmed.  These dogs are not suitable for living in an outdoor kennel because they are not reasonably resistant to the cold.  Make sure that where they sleep is dry and draught-free.

                 CHARACTER:  These dogs are calm and sociable indoors, to the point where they can even be considered lazy.  These dogs are intelligent, sensitive, bond strongly with their own people, have tremendous stamina, and do not bark much.  Greyhounds are not particularly vigilant.

                TRAINING:  Compared with the other fleet-footed keen-eyed hunters, the Greyhound is reasonably easy to train.  They can learn almost all commands and are fairly obedient except when they have set their eyes on prey.  Then they will ignore all your commands.  In some countries dogs of this entire group are not allowed out unless they remain on a leash, not just because of the danger they could present for wild animals but also the danger to themselves and road-users.  

                SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  It is instinctive for these dogs to chase anything that moves quickly, which means that they are not really suitable companions for people with one or more cats.  They seldom present difficulties with other dogs and are normally good with children.  With strangers, they tend to be rather cautious.

                 EXERCISE:  The dogs of this breed want to cover long distances running and walking.  Consider joining a Greyhound racing association because the dogs can really express their natural selves on a race track.  Trotting alongside a bicycle is a good alternative for working off the dog's energy.  It does not really matter how the dog gets its exercise provided it gets enough.

                 SPECIAL REMARKS:  Greyhounds which race differ quite a bit from these which must do well in the show ring. They are a very healthy breed and can live quite long.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Cuba. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Family Pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 22-29cm (8 1/2 - 11 1/2in). 

				COAT:  This dog has a long-haired coat without an undercoat.  Any color is accepted with the exception of black which is not recognized by some countries. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The coat needs considerable grooming.  These dogs need to be thoroughly brushed and combed at least twice a week with a coarse comb.  There is a lotion available to prevent the hair from splitting.  Clip excess hair from between the pads of the feet.  The feet themselves may be clipped to a round form.  This breed does not shed hair and dead hairs should be removed with a brush.  Check the eyes regularly. 

				CHARACTER:  These are cheerful, very affectionate, playful, gentle dogs which are highly intelligent, sociable, and sensitive. 

				TRAINING:  The Havanese learns quickly and enjoys doing things for you which is why this breed has a long reputation as a circus dog.  It is very sensitive to the intonation of your voice and harsh words will achieve very little except to upset the dog unnecessarily.  Some of them tend to bark more than necessary, so it is best to teach this dog when young not to do so before it becomes a habit. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  The Havanese gets along well with everyone including dogs and cats or other pets, and they can be fine too with children but they do not like to be pestered by them.  If they are pestered, the dog may become withdrawn for quite some time. 

				EXERCISE:  They have only an average need for exercise and three outings a day will keep them happy.

			"Hungarian Puli": {		
				

                    COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Hungary.

                    SPECIAL SKILLS:  Sheepdog or family pet.

                    SIZE:  The desired shoulder-height is 40 – 44cm (15 ½ - 17 ¼ in) for dogs and 37 – 41 cm (14 ½ - 16 ¼ in) for bitches.  The weight is 10 – 15kg (22 – 33lb). 

                    COAT:  The coat of the Puli is its trademark.  These dogs are richly covered in long cords of felted hair.  The Puli is usually black, but white, broken white, and black with apricot are also known.

                    CARE REQUIRED:  The Puli’s distinctive coat does not fully develop until the third year.  The soft under layer does not fall out but becomes felt on the outer, and harder, hairs.  If required, the felted strands are teased to encourage the development of the felt strands or cords.  An advantage of this coat is that the Puli does not shed, but there is a disadvantage that all manner of dirt and small objects can become caught up in the hairs.  Wash the Puli in the summer because the long coat will take several days to dry fully.

                    CHARACTER:  This intelligent dog learns easily, is full of character, animated, a good watchdog, and loyal to the family.  This breed is very adaptable to the circumstances surrounding it although it can be somewhat independent.  A Puli will rarely run away. 

                    TRAINING:  This breed requires a very consistent approach to training which needs to take place within the first year.  They do not like boring drills, preferring a challenge.  Vary the training routine constantly and include plenty of play. This breed usually learns quickly. 

                    SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  They normally get on well with their own kind, other animals, and children.  They have the tendency to bond quickly with one member of the family. 
                    EXERCISE:  This breed is in its element if it can romp and play with its unusual coat it is delightful to watch.  If you enjoy it, you could enroll both of you for agility skills or ball courses.  This breed also enjoys playing with Frisbees.  The Hungarian Puli usually does well in all these activities.

			"Ibizan Hound": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  The Balearic Islands.

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hunting dog (by sight, sound, and scent), and family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 66-72cm (26-28 1/2in) for dogs and 60-67cm (23 1/2-26 1/4in) for bitches.

				COAT:  The Ibizan Hound comes in short-haired, long-haired, and rough-haired varieties.  The most usual is the short-haired; the long-haired is very rare. The rough-haired has a longer coat of rough hair that is softer textured that the other two varieties. Predominant colors are various shades of red, white, or a combination of them.

				TRAINING:  This breed likes to learn and does so quickly.  Provided they have been properly trained, they can participate in many types of dog sports.  These dogs are very sensitive to the voice of their handler and a friendly request will always achieve more than a gruff command.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  These dogs get on well with children but hold back watchfully with strangers.  Once they decide the stranger means no harm, they will relax very quickly.  The dogs of this breed can be rather dominant towards other males.  If they were introduced to your cat when they were young, there will be no problems.  

				EXERCISE:  Despite the enormous ability to adapt of this breed - it can even be kept in an apartment - it still needs a great deal of exercise.  These dogs enjoy running alongside your bicycle but don't do this until your dog is fully grown as it can harm a young puppy. Keep in mind that these are basically hunting dogs and fence your yard with a fence of at least 2m (6ft 8in) as they can climb fences to escape if they want to go on the chase.  These dogs will greatly enjoy retrieving for you. 

				SPECIAL REMARKS:  Given their character, these dogs do not belong in a kennel.  They are considered half Greyhound because they hunt by sight, scent, and sound.

			"Irish Setter": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Ireland. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Field sports dog and family pet. 

				SIZE:  There are no standard dimensions.  The shoulder-height is about 65cm (25 1/2in) but there are many much larger specimens. 

				COAT:  The coat is relatively long and flat, with as few curls or waves as possible.  The color is rich chestnut without a trace of black.  Markings such as white on the chest, throat, chin, or feet, or a small star on the forehead and a white blaze are all undesirable. There is also a red-white Irish Setter which has a predominantly white coat with red markings. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  The Irish Setter should be trimmed occasionally, removing excess hair.  If you plan to show this dog much more elaborate grooming will be required.  For dogs kept solely as pets, the coat can be kept in condition between trims by clipping excess hair between the pads of the feet and underneath the ears to prevent infections that can occur if the ear is not ventilated.  

				CHARACTER:  These are lively, lovable, ,gentle, cheerful, and playful dogs that have minds of their own, and bond with their family.  Generally Irish Setters do not bark much. 

				TRAINING:  The training of these dogs is generally not difficult.  They are intelligent enough to understand quickly what is expected of them but they do have minds of their own, which calls for a handler who is both consistent and loving in approach.  It can be a good idea in some cases to attend a puppy training course with the dog.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  Irish Setter are usually loving so that even unwanted visitors are enthusiastically welcomed.  They do however let you know of the arrival of visitors.  With children they are friendly and patient and mix harmoniously with other dogs.  Mixing with other animals in the house will not be a problem if the young dog has learned to know early in its life. 

				EXERCISE:  Because this breed needs plenty of exercise you will need to take it on regular long walks.  Letting the dog run beside a bicycle is an ideal form of exercise once the dog is fully grown. 

				Some Irish Setters follow their nose when they come across what they consider to be an interesting scent and will have a deaf ear to your calls.  Teach the young dog that it must come to you when you order it to do so.

			"Irish Water Spaniel": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Ireland. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hunting dog and family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is 53-59cm (20 3/4 - 23 1/4in) for dogs and 51-56cm (20-22in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  The oily coat of the Irish Water Spaniel consists of dense, permanent curls which should never be fluffy.  The only recognized color is black shade of liver. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  Do not groom these dogs too much as otherwise the coat may become fluffy.  After a thorough brushing, the dog should be washed or allowed to swim to put the curl back in the coat.  It is likely that the coat will require trimming from time to time to keep it in accordance with the breed standard.  A major advantage of this coat is that loose hairs are not shed, so that few will be found on the carpet.  For showing they require more specialized grooming. 

				CHARACTER:  This dog is lively and cheerful, with considerable stamina and drive, and a very good nose.  It is intelligent, cunning, equable, and tough on itself.  It can have something of amid of its own.  

				TRAINING:  Training needs to begin early with these dogs.  They learn quickly but require consistent handling.  If the handler lets them have their own way too much and are too forgiving in the dog's eyes, the dog will lose all respect for its handler and refuse to obey.  Bring as much variety as possible into training and make sure the dog enjoys it.  These dogs can be very bad tempered.  Do not expect them to perform consistently.  

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  This breed usually gets on well with children.  There is no problem with the company of cats and other pets provided the dog has been socially trained when young. They will bark to warn of danger but that is all.  With strangers, they are rather cautious.  

				EXERCISE:  These are hunting dogs with tremendous stamina.  They enjoy retrieving and swimming greatly. These dogs are always ready for a good long walk.

			"Irish Wolfhound": {
			
				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Ireland. 

				SPECIAL SKILLS:  Hunter by sight of large game and family pet. 

				SIZE:  The shoulder-height is a minimum of 79cm (31 1/4in) for dogs and 71cm (28in) for bitches. 

				COAT:  The coat consists of rough, coarse, hard, and rather unkempt-looking hair.  They can be grey, grey roan, black, roe deer colored, and plain white.  Grey is the most common color. 

				CARE REQUIRED:  Regular and thorough grooming with brush and comb will keep the coat in good condition.  About once or twice a year pluck the coat to remove excess dead hair. 

				CHARACTER:  These are friendly, gently dogs that are kind to children, unconditionally loyal to their owner and family, pliable though not slavishly so, and calm. 

				TRAINING:  The Irish Wolfhound is relatively easy to train.  A gentle approach with plenty of understanding will go a long way because this dog quickly grasps what you intend.  Make sure that the young dog is given as much self-confidence as possible and that you are always consistent with it, so that it grows into an equable, confident dog.  Teach it not to pull on its leash before it gets too strong.  These dogs grow rapidly and high-quality food is essential.  Let the dog decide for itself how much exercise it wants. Forced exercise and long-distance walks are to taxing for this dog's body when it is young.  It takes two whole years before these dogs are fully grown. 

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR:  This breed normally gets on well with children and there should be no difficulty with other dogs.  This is also true for other animals if the dog has got to know them when it was young.  They need to be at the center of a family and will be very unhappy in a kennel.  They tend to greet everyone as a friend, so don't count on them as watchdogs. 

				EXERCISE:  These dogs adapt to your family circumstances and will not misbehave if the odd week passes with fewer chances to enjoy exercise, but that does not mean they do not enjoy being taken for long walks in the country.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:  Italy/Egypt.

				BREED NAMES: Old English Sheepdog, Bob Tail, Altenglischer Schaeferhund, Altenglischer Schäferhund .

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: England.

				SPECIAL SKILLS: Sheepdog and family pet.

				SIZE: The shoulder-height is a minimum of 60cm (23 ½ in) for males and 56cm (22in) for females.*

				COAT: The coat is luxuriant, rough, tough, and long with waterproof under-layer. Permitted colors are blue or different shades of grey. The head, neck, front quarters, and belly are white, with or without markings. White patches in the blue on the back are not permissible.

				CARE REQUIRED: These dogs require regular grooming: brush them thoroughly at least once a week, not overlooking the places where tangles form. When a dog is shedding it is possible to collect a half or even an entire garbage bag of hair. Keep the inside of the ears clean and remove both dirt and hair. The claws must be kept short so clip them regularly. Excessive hair between the pads of the feet should also be trimmed. For successful showing, the rear of the dog must be higher that the shoulders and this is sometimes accentuated for the show ring. Sometimes these dogs are trimmed, though unpopular with some purists, is better than a mass of tangled hair although it does seem strange that anyone would buy a long-haired dog and then have it clipped.

				CHARACTER: Intelligent, with considerable adaptability, amiable, social, not particularly alert, boisterous, uncomplicated nature, and likes to be part of the family.

				TRAINING: The breed needs gentle and consistent handling during training. It wants to please you and rarely displays dominant behavior, making it suitable for people with little experience with dogs. Because grooming is such an important a part of the general care for this breed, it is important to start brushing it when it is as young as possible. This prevents grooming degenerating into a wrestling match when it is much larger and stronger.

				SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: The Old English Sheepdog get on exceptionally well with other animals and children. Visitors too will be greeted warmly.

				EXERCISE: This breed needs a fair amount of exercise but it will not misbehave if you miss a day if you are exceptionally busy. Most of the breed are crazy about playing with a ball and are well represented as competition in various sports.

				COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Brussels, Belgium

				NAMES: Petit Brabançon, Small Brabant Griffon (Excepting for differences in coat and color, the Brussels Griffon, the Belgian Griffon and the Petit Brabancon have the same physical and temperament standards and are considered varieties of the same breed.)

				SPECIAL SKILLS: The three breeds (Brussels Griffon/Griffon Bruxellois/ Brüsseler Griffon, Belgian Griffon/Griffon Belge and Petit Brabançon) all descend from a small rough-coated dog called a “Smousje”, which for centuries has been found in the Brussels area. These little dogs are very alert and were bred to guard carriages and keep stables free from rodents.

				GROUP: F.C.I. Classification: Group 9: Companion and Toy Dogs; Section 3.2: Small Belgian Dogs – Petit Brabançon; #082; AKC: Toy Group

				HEIGHT AT WITHERS: (21 – 28 cm) See WEIGHT comments below.

				WEIGHT: (2.5 – 6 kg) A proper Griffon should be muscular, compact, and well-boned, and should not seem delicate, racy, or overly cobby. The Griffon often feels heavier than it is for such a small size. Because they are judged by weight rather than by shoulder height, proper proportioning is essential to determine whether a dog is too fat, too slim, or too tall for its size. Note: These sizes are average; your dog can be smaller or bigger than average size.

				COAT and COLORS: The Petit Brabançon is short-coated. The hair is harsh, flat and gleaming, and at most 2 cm long. The following are the accepted colors: Black or black and tan. The tan markings must be pure and of a sustained color. They are present on the front legs, from foot to wrist, on the hind legs from foot to hock; up the inside of the legs; on the chest, on the cheeks, on the chin, above the eyes, inside the ears, below the tail and around the anus. The black can be mixed with red-brown, which is allowed although pure black and black and tan are preferred. Red, reddish; a little black (dark mask) is allowed on the head furnishing.. A few white hairs on the chest are tolerated but not sought after.

				BUILD: All three breeds are sturdy toy dogs with thick-set, well-balanced bodies, giving a squared appearance in proportion when viewed from the side. Length of body, from point of shoulder to point of buttock should be as equal as possible to height at withers.

				HEAD : This is the most characteristic part of the body and the most striking. The head is quite large compared with the body and has an almost human expression.

				CRANIAL REGION : Broad and round. The forehead is well-rounded. Stop : Very pronounced.

				FACIAL REGION : Nose : Black. The nose is set at the same level as the eyes. Nose leather is broad with wide-open nostrils. The tip of the nose is tilted back so that in profile the chin, the nose and the forehead are on the same plane. Muzzle : The foreface including the nose is very short : it must not exceed 1.5 cm. For the Petit Brabançon a correct foreface appears longer because it has no furnishing. A poor expression is given by a non-turned-up foreface, just as it is by a nose whose top line lies below the line from the bottom of the eyes and these are both serious faults. Lips : Black. The top and bottom lips are in close contact and close-fitting. The upper lip does not form flews and does not overlap the lower lip. If it is too loose it spoils the desired expression. Jaws/teeth : The lower jaw is curved upwards, broad, non-pointed and jutting beyond the upper jaw; the breed is undershot. The incisors on each jaw are expected to be regularly set and in a straight line, with upper and lower remaining really parallel. The mouth must be tightly closed, showing neither teeth nor tongue. The width and prominence of the chin are extremely important. Care must be taken to ensure that no incisors are missing. Eyes : Well set apart, large and round, never bulging. Brown, as dark as possible. The eye is to be edged with black and preferably no white of eye is to be seen. Small, oval or light coloured eyes are a fault. Ears : Small, set high with enough space between them. Uncropped ears carried semi-erect and falling forwards. Ears which are too big are undesirable, so are ears falling on the side of the head. Cropped ears are pointed and erect. Cropped and uncropped ears are equally acceptable.

				NECK : Medium length; blends harmoniously into the shoulders.

				BODY : The length of the body practically equals the height at the withers. The overall impression is of small square powerful dog. Withers : Slightly raised. Back : Straight, short, strong. Loins : Short and muscled, very slightly arched. Croup : Broad and flat or only very slightly sloping. Chest : Broad, well let down to elbows. The breastbone is well defined, which gives a slightly jutting chest in profile. Ribs well-sprung but not barrel nor too flat. Underline : Belly slightly tucked up; flanks clearly defined.

				TAIL : Set high and carried quite high. A docked tail is shortened y 2/3 of its length. A non-docked tail is carried upwards with the tip towards the back without ever reaching it or being curled. A naturally short or broken or curly tail is a severe fault.

				LIMBS

				FOREQUARTERS: Overview : Front legs parallel with good bone, set sufficiently wide apart. Shoulders : Normal shoulder angulation. Elbows : Close to body. Wrists : Strong. Feet : Small, round, neither turning out nor in. Tight fitting toes; fused toes are undesirable. Thick pads as dark as possible. Nails preferably black, as dark as possible.

				HINDQUARTERS : Overview : Hind legs with good bone, really parallel, angulated to balance with front legs. Stifles : Sufficient angulation. Hocks : Well let down, neither close nor open. Feet : See forequarters. Dewclaws not sought after.

				GAIT/MOVEMENT : Powerful, parallel movement of limbs with good rear drive. High-stepping front movement and ambling are faults.

				A proper Griffon should be muscular, compact, and well-boned, and should not seem delicate, racy, or overly cobby. The Griffon often feels heavier than it is for such a small size. Because they are judged by weight rather than by shoulder height, proper proportioning is essential to determine whether a dog is too fat, too slim, or too tall for its size.

				ELIMINATING FAULTS : Temperament: Aggressive or overly shy. Nose lacking pigment or other than black. Tongue permanently visible, the mouth being closed. Wry lower jaw. Upper jaw protruding beyond lower jaw. Any other colours than those laid down in the standard, such as grey, blue and tan, brown and tan, liver colour. Any white patch. * Note: The size and aesthetic characteristics indicated are the general goals of most breeders and may vary among the breed.

				CHARACTER: The Griffon Bruxellois is known to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with his or her master. They display a visible air of self-importance. A Griffon should not be shy or aggressive; however, they are very emotionally sensitive, and because of this, should be socialized carefully at a young age. Griffons should also be alert, inquisitive and interested in their surroundings. Griffons tend to bond with one human more than others. This, along with their small size, may make them unsuitable as a family pet, especially for a family with very small children. Griffons tend to get along well with other animals in the house, including cats, ferrets, and other dogs. However, they can get into trouble because they have no concept of their own relative size and may attempt to dominate dogs much larger than themselves. Some say: "Having a Griffon means having a true constant companion. They need their favorite person all the time, and will be very unhappy if left outdoors or alone most of the day. A Griffon Bruxellois will want to follow you about the house, on your errands, and to bed."

				CARE REQUIRED: The Griffon sheds little to no hair and therefore need grooming on an as needed basis.

				EXERCISE REQUIRED: These little dogs are very active indoors, however, like all dogs, they still need to be taken for a daily walk to fulfill a dog's primal instinct to walk.

				HEALTH ISSUES: Prone to slipped stifle, eye (lens luxation and glaucoma) and respiratory problems. Due to their shortened snout, Griffons are very sensitive to the heat and should not be walked in extreme heat. Not the easiest whelpers, dams often require a cesarean section. Average lifespan is about 12-15 years.

The breed is lean, but with massive bone structure and strongly developed musculature. Secondary sex characteristics are strongly marked, with the males being stronger, more massive and more courageous than the females.

				HEAD/NECK : Elongated shape with a moderately broad forehead; the occipital crest and the zygomatic arches are strongly pronounced. The stop should be barely visible. The eyes should have an oval shape, set horizontally, and dark; the eyelids should be darkly pigmented, lean, and fit close to the eye. The nose should be large and black. The teeth should meet in a scissor bite. The ears should be relatively small, of triangular shape, and hang down. The neck should be lean, muscular, of moderate length and set high on the withers.

				BODY/TAIL/LEGS/FEET: The withers should be apparent; the back straight; the loin short, broad and rounded. The chest should be reasonably broad, slightly flattened and deep to the elbows.

				CHARACTER: Fierce, distrustful of strangers, and dominant in character, the South Russian Shepherd Dog is capable of adjusting to a wide variety of climatic conditions and temperatures. This breed is known for its versatility. They have a multifaceted character, are playful and humorous, lively and active, and extremely faithful and devoted to his master and those over whom he watches. These dogs are protective, serious, reserved, and can become dominant if their owners are not strong pack leaders; they require firm and consistent training as they can be very independent and can have a short attention span. Given a dominant trainer/handler, this breed can do exceptionally wellDespite their size, they are flexible, quick, agile, obedient and teachable as a hunting dog. This dog must be socialized early to the different types of people and pets with which it will share its life.

				CARE REQUIRED: The long and thick coat need daily grooming. As with all dogs with furry hanging ears, weekly ear cleaning is recommended to prevent moisture build up and possible infections.

				EXERCISE REQUIRED: This breed is not suitable to apartment or city life. The possessive nature of this dog requires extensive property, a sizable family, and preferably other animals that it can protect.

				HEALTH ISSUES: South Russian Ovcharkas can become quite old. The age of 10 till 12 years is not an exception. In general they are healthy dog
