It makes many people happy, but eventually, you’re going to get that one person who inevitably wants the practicality of a pickup but in a smaller package.\r\n\r\nSure, it’s a novel concept at first, but it rarely works because practicality is usually compromised due to their smaller size. Then there’s the aesthetic factor — a car with its rear end lopped off and replaced with a bed looks downright frumpy. Yet somehow, as automakers experiment with car-based pickups, frumpy turns into funky because some of these creations over the years actually look hilarious … both in good and bad ways. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s a handful of some of our favourites:\r\n\r\nBMW M3 Pickup\r\nThe BMW M3 Pickup\r\n\r\nThe BMW M3 Pickup\r\nHandout, BMW\r\n\r\nIn the weeks leading up to April Fools’ Day three years ago, BMW was “testing” a new variant of the now previous-generation M3 family on the Nurburgring. As it turns out, it was a prank, but a good one nonetheless because the M3 Pickup created such a buzz. Powered by the standard M3?s V8 engine, it pumps out 420 horsepower and is surprisingly only 110 pounds heavier than the M3 convertible. It features a reasonably sized bed out back, as well as a targa roof because open-air motoring is a must. Although you would think BMW would rush to putting it into production given its knack for niche vehicles, the M3 Pickup is a one-off model used as a workshop vehicle to ferry around parts for the M division.\r\n\r\nChevrolet El Camino\r\nThe Chevrolet El Camino\r\n\r\nThe Chevrolet El Camino\r\nHandout, GM\r\n\r\nThis is the car-based pickup that arguably started it all back in 1959. Based on the Chevrolet Brookwoods wagon, the El Camino was basically GM’s answer to the Ford Ranchero. It was something of a hit in 1959, but its popularity faded a year later and was discontinued. But in 1964, GM gave the El Camino a new lease on life and a new platform along with it. It was now based on the Chevrolet Chevelle, and that meant it also shared its engines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;That’s actually a good thing, particularly in 1970 because that is when GM stuffed the Chevelle’s massive LS5 454 cubic-inch V8 under the hood of certain El Caminos, giving it 425 horsepower, 460 lb.-ft. of torque. Quarter-mile times ruled back in the age of the muscle car, and the 454-equipped El Camino could do it in about 13 seconds. Even by today’s standards, that’s pretty impressive.\r\n\r\nChevrolet SSR\r\nThe Chevrolet SSR\r\n\r\nThe Chevrolet SSR\r\nHandout, GM\r\n\r\nAs a concept car at the 2000 North American International Auto Show, the outlandish Chevrolet SSR was acceptable. After all, concepts are for dreaming, right? Well, three years later and for some odd reason, GM decided to build the SSR. It certainly had the performance chops, at least on paper — it was powered by GM’s 5.3-litre Vortec V8 engine pumping out 300 horsepower. Unfortunately, it was initially paired to a four-speed automatic transmission, which neutered performance to say the least. Nothing could save the SSR — be it the retro styling or the Corvette-derived LS2 V8 and six-speed manual added in 2005 — from the chopping block.\r\n\r\nFord Falcon and Holden Commodore Ute\r\nThe HSV Maloo R8\r\n\r\nThe HSV Maloo R8\r\nHandout, GM\r\n\r\nShort for “utility,” utes are an interesting niche of the automotive industry. Again, similar in concept to the El Camino, utes are especially popular in Australia for their driving dynamics, looks (hey, beauty is subjective…) and practicality. At least we can get behind the performance part: Holden, for instance, offers the HSV Maloo R8, based on the Commodore and complete with a 6.2-litre, 425-horsepower V8 under the hood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk about hauling!\r\n\r\nMini Paceman Adventure\r\nThe Mini Paceman Adventure\r\n\r\nThe Mini Paceman Adventure\r\nHandout, BMW\r\n\r\nNow we’re beginning to think BMW has a secret affinity for car-based pickups. Developed by a team of interns at the automaker’s Munich and Dingolfing plants, the Mini Paceman Adventure is considerably more awesome than its chubby, fixed-roof coupe variant. Under the skin, the Paceman Adventure is powered by a 184-horsepower turbo-four, fed to all four wheels via a six-speed manual. But that’s not all: there’s a bunch of features that make it surprisingly badass, including a beefed-up suspension, a snorkel and some very bright spotlights. And like the M3 Pickup, the Paceman Adventure is road legal, but that doesn’t mean it’s going into production.\r\n\r\nPeugeot 207 Hoggar\r\nThe Peugeot 207 Hoggar\r\n\r\nThe Peugeot 207 Hoggar\r\nHandout, Peugeot\r\n\r\nOriginally, the Peugeot Hoggar was basically a really cool dune buggy with a one-piece carbon honeycomb body, four-wheel-drive and two diesel engines. Unfortunately, none of that awesomeness seems to have transferred into the production version, which has been available in South America since 2010.\r\n\r\nSubaru BRAT/Baja\r\nThe Subaru Baja\r\n\r\nThe Subaru Baja\r\nHandout, Subaru\r\n\r\nUntil recently, Subaru has strayed from the mainstream by focusing on often oddball vehicles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among them is the Subaru Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter, or BRAT for short. Introduced in 1978, the BRAT’s most distinguishing feature was the rear-facing jumpseats in the bed, which didn’t do much in the way of practicality. Then, in 2003, Subaru followed up on the BRAT’s formula with the Baja, an equally offbeat “pickup” based on the Legacy that, once again, wasn’t all that practical. It wasn’t that pretty, either.\r\n\r\nSuzuki Mighty Boy\r\nThe Suzuki Mighty Boy\r\n\r\nThe Suzuki Mighty Boy\r\nSupplied, Wikimedia Commons\r\n\r\nThe grass is almost always greener on the other side, which probably explains why those itty-bitty subcompact “Kei” cars are so popular in Japan. There are plenty of variants tooting around, including hatchbacks, baby convertibles, and evidently pickups. It’s probably the only 550-cc pickup, and despite its underpinnings shared with the Suzuki Cervo, the Mighty Boy was classified as a commercial vehicle. These cute little things evidently still have a dedicated following in Japan, probably because it easily wins over your heart with its pint-sized everything despite them being not exactly practical, what with a bed measuring 600 millimetres long and all that.', 'Pickup, Suzuki, BMW M3', 'eight_useless_and_funky_pickups_you_secretly_want'),

In addition, the Cayenne Turbo S is also expected to see a similar hybrid option. All three vehicles will be tagged with the e-Hybrid badge, like the 918 Spyder, though it’s unclear if those models will outright replace the Turbo S versions as the flagship performance models.\r\n\r\nAs for the Cayenne, we already told you about the “coupe” variant in the pipeline. Porsche is still on track to launch it as the Cayenne Sport Turismo, offered initially in e-Hybrid form and with less powerful (and less expensive) variants to follow.\r\n\r\nA Sport Turismo version is also in the cards for the Panamera, which is expected to account for 20 per cent of total sales.
